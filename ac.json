      "Product details of Imported DC Inverter 0.75 Ton Window Air Conditioner \n\n \n\nSpecifications of Cool Imported DC Inverter - 0.75 Ton Window Air Conditioner \nWindow Air Conditioner\n\nOne of the cheapest solutions for home cooling is to find afunction over quality. Besides, an ideal window air conditioner available online in Pakistan should function between 9,000 to 14,000 BTUs on the upside. Its costs less, yet it benefits in the long term and the installation process is adequately simple. Multiple factors such as design, the right size, and brand carry additional aspects that is directly depended in the space provided for cooling.\n\nBest Air Conditioner Online in Pakistan\n\nHave you considered the idea to buy 1 ton air conditioner in Pakistan if your need is to cool a single room? Whereas, if the solution requires for a bigger space cooling then turn towards split air conditioners online as these accumulate more space but gives more cooling. Take measurements before you begin your purchase, for example, that about 8,000 BTUs are enough to freeze 350 square feet of space throughout the day. Window air conditioner consists of a compressor, evaporator, and condenser.\n\nWhy Choose Window AC over Split AC?\n\nBasically it is the old version of the modern split air conditioner you are accustomed to see around the electronic sphere. What sets the two models apart is the design and installation (function). Window air conditioner is fixed when its cooling fins are facing indoors, but the heating unit is kept on the opposing side. Firstly, the inner compartments contains fans at the front with evaporators behind and its filter in the middle that’s operated via the central control panel. Secondly, the condenser along with the compressor is mashed in a box that is kept outward for noise reduction and of course to minimize the space.\n\nAlmost equally powerful – as explained above – a 0.75 ton air conditioner in Pakistan is available according to the home and office requirement of any consumer."

Secondly, the condenser along with the compressor is mashed in a box that is kept outward for noise reduction and of course to minimize the space.\n\nAlmost equally powerful – as explained above – a 1 ton air conditioner in Pakistan is available according to the home and office requirement of any consumer.\n\nSpecifications of SkyWood Cool SKP-1224 HWB1 Ton Portable Air Conditioner White\nDESCRIPTION\n\nIt’s Skywood Italian technology 1 ton AC with touch display and remote control.Cooling is 100% like brand new fitt for room or office with moveable tyres and adjustable, washable exhaust compressor and body is in best condition like brand new u can never find such AC in this condition.

It works best with doors and windows open and fresh air for personal well-being.\n\nClose Comfort works in any size of room, even outside in sheltered places. Set up Close Comfort on your roof during the hottest nights in summer and sleep under the stars!\n\nConvenience\n\nClose Comfort is portable and ready to use out of the box: just connect it to the nearest power outlet. Only 17 kg, it requires no installation, no water tank, and no pipe to the window.\n\nMinimal maintenance: just check the filters every two weeks. No consumables, no water, no ice, no recharging.\n\nPower\n\n1.2 kVA UPS recommended, 120 Amp-hour battery set.\n\nCooling Power\n\nRated cooling power is 0.25 ton, 2500-3500 BTU/hour. This air conditioner provides localized cooling where it is needed.\n\nNormal room air conditioners provide more cooling power, and can cool a whole room, but require 4-8 times as much electricity to run.

      "Product details of Skywood Cool SKW-09R Window Air Conditioner - 0.75 Ton\nWindow Air Conditioner\nOne of the cheapest solutions for home cooling is to find afunction over quality. Besides, an ideal window air conditioner available online in Pakistan should function between 9,000 to 14,000 BTUs on the upside. Its costs less, yet it benefits in the long term and the installation process is adequately simple. Multiple factors such as design, the right size, and brand carry additional aspects that is directly depended in the space provided for cooling.\nBest Air Conditioner Online in Pakistan\nHave you considered the idea to buy 1 ton air conditioner in Pakistan if your need is to cool a single room? Whereas, if the solution requires for a bigger space cooling then turn towards split air conditioners online as these accumulate more space but gives more cooling. Take measurements before you begin your purchase, for example, that about 8,000 BTUs are enough to freeze 350 square feet of space throughout the day. Window air conditioner consists of a compressor, evaporator, and condenser.\nWhy Choose Window AC over Split AC?\nBasically it is the old version of the modern split air conditioner you are accustomed to see around the electronic sphere. What sets the two models apart is the design and installation (function). Window air conditioner is fixed when its cooling fins are facing indoors, but the heating unit is kept on the opposing side. Firstly, the inner compartments contains fans at the front with evaporators behind and its filter in the middle that’s operated via the central control panel. Secondly, the condenser along with the compressor is mashed in a box that is kept outward for noise reduction and of course to minimize the space.\nAlmost equally powerful – as explained above – a 0.75 ton air conditioner in Pakistan is available according to the home and office requirement of any consumer."

      "Product details of Gree 0.75 Ton Window Air Conditioner with Remote Control - White\n\nSpecifications of Window Air Conditioner With Remote Control - 0.75 Ton - White\nNot Obsolete Window Air Conditioner\n\nOne of the cheapest solutions for home cooling is to find afunctionoverquality. Besides, an ideal windowair conditioneravailable online in Pakistan should function between 9,000 to 14,000 BTUs on the upside. Its costs less, yet it benefits in the long term and the installation process is adequately simple. Multiple factors such as design, the right size, and brand carry additional aspects that is directly depended in the space provided for cooling.\n\nBest Air Conditioner Online in Pakistan\n\nHave you considered the idea to buy 0.75ton air conditioner in Pakistan if your need is to cool a single room? Whereas, if the solution requires for a bigger space cooling then turn towards split air conditioners online as these accumulate more space but gives more cooling. Take measurements before you begin your purchase, for example, that about 8,000 BTUs are enough to freeze 350 square feet of space throughout the day. Window air conditioner consists of a compressor, evaporator, and condenser.\n\nWhy Choose Window AC over Split AC?\n\nBasically it is the old version of the modernsplit air conditioneryou are accustomed to see around the electronic sphere. What sets the two models apart is the design and installation (function). Window air conditioner is fixed when its cooling fins are facing indoors, but the heating unit is kept on the opposing side. Firstly, the inner compartments contains fans at the front with evaporators behind and its filter in the middle that’s operated via the central control panel. Secondly, the condenser along with the compressor is mashed in a box that is kept outward for noise reduction and of course to minimize the space.\n\nAlmost equally powerful – as explained above – a 0.75ton air conditioner in Pakistan is available according to the home and office requirement of any consumer."

      "Triangle Design For Powerful Cooling\n\nThe Samsung Air Conditioner’s unique triangular design improves its performance, circulating cool air faster, farther and wider* around your home. Its Digital Inverter also provides significantly greater energy efficiency.** And its Virus Doctor and Easy Filter eliminates dust, contaminants, allergens, bacteria and viruses*** - firstly using a filter and secondly with Virus Doctor. * Tested on AR09HSFSBWK model. Compared with Samsung conventional model AQV09TWS. ** Tested on AR09HSSDAWK/EU. Compared with Samsung conventional model AQ09TSB. *** Tested in Kitasato Environmental Science Centre (Japan) & Yonsei Univ. (Korea) / Korea test lab (FITI / KEMTI) and Japan test lab (ITEA). Effective on 4 viruses, including Subtype H1N1, and certain bacteria. Data has been measured under specific testing conditions and may differ based on environmental factors.\n\nCools Faster, Farther, and Wider\n\nThe Samsung Air Conditioner has been designed from the ground up to be outstandingly efficient. Its uniquely triangular design has a wider inlet, so more air can be drawn in. The improved width and angle of its outlet, extra v-blades and a bigger fan also ensure that air is cooled and expelled faster, farther and wider*. So refreshingly cool air reaches every corner of your room. * Tested on AR09HSFSBWK model. Compared with Samsung conventional model AQV09TWS.\n\nCools You Fast Then Cools You Comfortably\n\nThe Samsung Air Conditioner begins cooling the air fast using its powerful Fast Cool mode, so it gets there quickly. It then automatically changes the mode to Comfort Cool to maintain the desired temperature. So you won’t feel cold and don’t have to keep manually changing the settings or turning the Air Conditioner on and off.\n\nAutomatically Save Energy\n\nWith Single User mode, you don’t have to repeatedly turn the Samsung Air Conditioner on and off to save energy or worry about using it if it’s not unbearably hot. Inthis mode, the compressor and fan only run long enough to maintain the desired temperature and automatically shut off when they’re not needed. So it uses much less electricity * – keeping your bills low and your rooms cool. * Tested on AR12HPSDDWK. Based on accumulated power consumption of normal mode vs. single user mode\n\nEliminates Viruses\n\nVirus Doctor and Easy Filter eliminates dust, dangerous airborne contaminants and allergens, as well as bacteria and viruses, including the Influenza A and Corona viruses* – firstly using a filter and secondly with Virus Doctor. So it keeps the air you breathe clean and healthy. * Tested in Kitasato Environmental Science Centre (Japan) & Yonsei Univ. (Korea) / Korea test lab (FITI / KEMTI) and Japan test lab (ITEA). Effective on 4 viruses, including Subtype H1N1, and certain bacteria. Data has been measured under specific testing conditions and may differ based on environmental factors.\n\nStable, Long-lasting Performance\n\nThe Samsung Air Conditioner keeps going in the most challenging environments. Its Triple Protector Plus technology prevents the compressor and controller from being overloaded by power surges and fluctuating electrical currents, without a separate voltage stabiliser. It also has an anti-corrosive coating to stop the condenser from corrosion, and cabinet from rusting. And its larger condenser and optimised refrigerant flow mean it can endure extremely hot temperatures (up to 58 ºC)*. * Tested on AR09HPSDDWK/SG. Compared with Samsung conventional model AR09HPSDFAP/RC\n\nEasy to Take Out and Clean\n\nUnlike conventional filters that are often difficult to access, the Samsung Air Conditioner’s Easy Filter is located outside, on the top. So it can easily be taken out, cleaned and put back – without having to open a cover or pull hard to get it out. And its anti-bacterial coating filters dust, dangerous airborne contaminants and allergens.* * Tested in Korea test lab (FITI / KEMTI) and Japan test lab (ITEA). Data has been measured under specific testing conditions and may differ based on environmental factors.\n\nSmartly Convenient\n\nWith the Samsung Air Conditioner you can enjoy the confidence that it's perfectly installed and the convenience of remote control and trouble-shooting. Smart Installation checks for common problems to make sure it is properly installed. Using an App on your smartphone, Smart Wi-Fi lets you monitor and change energy settings from anywhere and Smart Check lets you diagnose errors and request a service immediately.\n\nEnsure Perfect Installation\n\nSmart Installation is a self-diagnosis feature that ensures your Samsung Air Conditioner is installed perfectly by your service engineer. It automatically checks for installation faults that can cause problems when using the air conditioner, including ineffective communication with the outdoor unit, any issues with the integrity of the air pipe and poor refrigerant flow.\n\nEasy Troubleshooting\n\nThe Samsung Air Conditioner includes Smart Check, an automatic error-monitoring system. It detects and diagnoses problems at an early stage and provides quick and easy troubleshooting solutions using a smartphone App*. So it saves you time having to find the manual and avoids the cost and inconvenience of unnecessary engineer callouts** – and potentially expensive repair bills. * Available on iPhones and Android devices. ** This function operates for certain error mode only and is not substitute for periodic service checkup."

      "Description\nSpecifications of Window Air Conditioner With Remote Control - 0.75 Ton - White\nOld But Not Obsolete Window Air Conditioner\n\nOne of the cheapest solutions for home cooling is to find afunctionoverquality. Besides, an ideal windowair conditioner available online in Pakistan should function between 9,000 to 14,000 BTUs on the upside. Its costs less, yet it benefits in the long term and the installation process is adequately simple. Multiple factors such as design, the right size, and brand carry additional aspects that is directly depended in the space provided for cooling.\n\nBest Air Conditioner Online in Pakistan\n\nHave you considered the idea to buy 1 ton air conditioner in Pakistan if your need is to cool a single room? Whereas, if the solution requires for a bigger space cooling then turn towards split air conditioners online as these accumulate more space but gives more cooling. Take measurements before you begin your purchase, for example, that about 8,000 BTUs are enough to freeze 350 square feet of space throughout the day. Window air conditioner consists of a compressor, evaporator, and condenser.\n\nWhy Choose Window AC over Split AC?\n\nBasically it is the old version of the modern split air conditioner you are accustomed to see around the electronic sphere. What sets the two models apart is the design and installation (function). Window air conditioner is fixed when its cooling fins are facing indoors, but the heating unit is kept on the opposing side. Firstly, the inner compartments contains fans at the front with evaporators behind and its filter in the middle that’s operated via the central control panel. Secondly, the condenser along with the compressor is mashed in a box that is kept outward for noise reduction and of course to minimize the space.\n\nAlmost equally powerful – as explained above – a 1 ton air conditioner in Pakistan is available according to the home and office requirement of any consumer."

Take measurements before you begin your purchase, for example, that about 12,000 BTUs are enough to freeze 90 to180 square feet of space throughout the day. Portable air conditioner consists of a compressor, evaporator, and condenser.\n\nWhy Choose Portable AC over Split AC?\n\nBasically it is the old version of the modern split air conditioner you are accustomed to see around the electronic sphere. What sets the two models apart is the design and installation (function). Portable air conditioner is fixed when its cooling fins are facing indoors, but the heating unit is kept on the opposing side. Firstly, the inner compartments contains fans at the front with evaporators behind and its filter in the middle that’s operated via the central control panel. Secondly, the condenser along with the compressor is mashed in a box that is kept outward for noise reduction and of course to minimize the space.\n\nAlmost equally powerful – as explained above – a 1 ton air conditioner in Pakistan is available according to the home and office requirement of any consumer."

      "Product details of Skywood 1224 1 Ton Window Air Conditioner\nWindow Air Conditioner\nOne of the cheapest solutions for home cooling is to find afunctionoverquality. Besides, an ideal window air conditioner available online in Pakistan should function between 9,000 to 14,000 BTUs on the upside. Its costs less, yet it benefits in the long term and the installation process is adequately simple. Multiple factors such as design, the right size, and brand carry additional aspects that is directly depended in the space provided for cooling.\nBest Air Conditioner Online in Pakistan\nHave you considered the idea to buy 1 ton air conditioner in Pakistan if your need is to cool a single room? Whereas, if the solution requires for a bigger space cooling then turn towards split air conditioners online as these accumulate more space but gives more cooling. Take measurements before you begin your purchase, for example, that about 8,000 BTUs are enough to freeze 350 square feet of space throughout the day. Window air conditioner consists of a compressor, evaporator, and condenser.\nWhy Choose Window AC over Split AC?\nBasically it is the old version of the modern split air conditioner you are accustomed to see around the electronic sphere. What sets the two models apart is the design and installation (function). Window air conditioner is fixed when its cooling fins are facing indoors, but the heating unit is kept on the opposing side. Firstly, the inner compartments contains fans at the front with evaporators behind and its filter in the middle that’s operated via the central control panel. Secondly, the condenser along with the compressor is mashed in a box that is kept outward for noise reduction and of course to minimize the space. Almost equally powerful – as explained above – a 1 ton air conditioner in Pakistan is available according to the home and office requirement of any consumer."

      "Triangle Design For Powerful Cooling\n\nThe Samsung Air Conditioner's unique triangular design improves its performance, circulating cool air faster, farther and wider* around your home. Its Digital Inverter also provides significantly greater energy efficiency.** And its Virus Doctor and Easy Filter eliminates dust, contaminants, allergens, bacteria and viruses*** - firstly using a filter and secondly with Virus Doctor.\n\n\n\n\nCools Faster, Farther, and Wider\n\nThe Samsung Air Conditioner has been designed from the ground up to be outstandingly efficient. Its uniquely triangular design has a wider inlet, so more air can be drawn in. The improved width and angle of its outlet, extra v-blades and a bigger fan also ensure that air is cooled and expelled faster, farther and wider*. So refreshingly cool air reaches every corner of your room.\n\n\n\n\nCools You Fast Then Cools You Comfortably\n\nThe Samsung Air Conditioner begins cooling the air fast using its powerful Fast Cool mode, so it gets there quickly. It then automatically changes the mode to Comfort Cool to maintain the desired temperature. So you won't feel cold and don't have to keep manually changing the settings or turning the Air Conditioner on and off.\n\n\n\n\nWorks Smart. Saves Energy\n\nThe Samsung Air Conditioner features an energy-efficient Digital Inverter with EER 10.1. It can maintain the desired temperature without frequently shutting off and on, so it consumes less energy. The Digital Inverter helps you to stay comfortable for long periods of time, while using the minimum amount of energy.\n\n\n\n\nSave Energy Even When Alone\n\nThe Samsung Air Conditioner's Single User mode uses less compressor capacity, reducing power consumption*, while still providing a cool and comfortable environment. So you can use it when you're alone, even during a hot day, without worrying about the electricity bill."

      "Window Air Conditioner\nOne of the cheapest solutions for home cooling is to find a function over quality. Besides, an ideal window air conditioner available online in Pakistan should function between 9,000 to 14,000 BTUs on the upside. Its costs less, yet it benefits in the long term and the installation process is adequately simple. Multiple factors such as design, the right size, and brand carry additional aspects that is directly depended in the space provided for cooling.\nBest Air Conditioner Online in Pakistan\nHave you considered the idea to buy 1 ton air conditioner in Pakistan if your need is to cool a single room? Whereas, if the solution requires for a bigger space cooling then turn towards split air conditioners online as these accumulate more space but gives more cooling. Take measurements before you begin your purchase, for example, that about 8,000 BTUs are enough to freeze 180 square feet of space throughout the day. Window air conditioner consists of a compressor, evaporator, and condenser.\nWhy Choose Window AC over Split AC?\nBasically it is the old version of the modern split air conditioner you are accustomed to see around the electronic sphere. What sets the two models apart is the design and installation (function). Window air conditioner is fixed when its cooling fins are facing indoors, but the heating unit is kept on the opposing side. Firstly, the inner compartments contains fans at the front with evaporators behind and its filter in the middle that’s operated via the central control panel. Secondly, the condenser along with the compressor is mashed in a box that is kept outward for noise reduction and of course to minimize the space. Almost equally powerful – as explained above – a 1 Ton air conditioner in Pakistan is available according to the home and office requirement of any consumer."

      "The equipment has DC Inverter compressors and in addition the motors have fans of the indoor and outdoor unit operated without brushes, supplied in continuous electric power. This configuration ensures high power efficiency in all temperature conditions (the SEER / SCOP seasonal energy efficiency class is A / A).The equipment is equipped with 2 ambient temperature sensors, one on the remote control and one in the indoor unit. This configuration helps to more accurately monitor indoor air temperature;They can be used for special applications (server cameras) because they function efficiently in cooling even at temperatures of -15 ° C. Celsius.On start-up, the absorbed electric current has a low intensity due to the special inverter, which ensures easy operation in situations where the electrical installation is loaded at the limit.The condensate pump is incorporated into the inner unit and ensures the safe removal of the condensation that forms during operation;Innovative fan design ensures indoor unit operation with low noise level;The angle of inclination of the air guiding blinds is different depending on the operating mode. L Cooling operation ensures that the air is directed to the upper part of the enclosure, while the heating operation is directed towards the lower part of the enclosure. This ensures an optimal distribution of air both during cooling and heating"

Pay only Rs 1000 – 1500 a month for electricity.\n\nRoom air conditioners waste 90% of more of the cooling power on walls, floors, furniture, Close Comfort uses only 300 Watts, less than four light bulbs.\n\nIt’s affordable, good for ecology, economy and the environment.\n\nComfort\n\nSoft, focused cool air for comfort. The Igloo tent provides so much space around you.\n\nWake truly refreshed because you sleep through load shedding in fresh air from open windows.\n\nClose Comfort provides a soft focused flow of cool air to provide personal comfort and is almost silent. It works best with doors and windows open and fresh air for personal well-being.\n\nClose Comfort works in any size of room, even outside in sheltered places. Set up Close Comfort on your roof during the hottest m in summer and sleep under the stars!\n\nConvenience\n\nClose Comfort is portable and ready to use out of the box: just connect it to the nearest power outlet. Only 17 kg, it requires no installation, no water tank, and no pipe to the window.\n\nMinimal maintenance: just check the filters every two weeks. No consumables, no water, no ice, no recharging.\n\nPower\n\n1.2 kVA UPS recommended, 120 Amp-hour battery set.\n\nCooling Power\n\nRated cooling power is 0.25 ton, 2500-3500 BTU/hour. This air conditioner provides localized cooling where it is needed.\n\nNormal room air conditioners provide more cooling power, and can cool a whole room, but require 4-8 times as much electricity to run. Beware of the electricity cost which will be much higher."

      "Product details of Skywood 1 Ton Window Air Conditioner\nWindow Air Conditioner\n\nOne of the cheapest solutions for home cooling is to find afunctionoverquality. Besides, an ideal window air conditioner available online in Pakistan should function between 9,000 to 14,000 BTUs on the upside. Its costs less, yet it benefits in the long term and the installation process is adequately simple. Multiple factors such as design, the right size, and brand carry additional aspects that is directly depended in the space provided for cooling.\n\nBest Air Conditioner Online in Pakistan\n\nHave you considered the idea to buy 1 ton air conditioner in Pakistan if your need is to cool a single room? Whereas, if the solution requires for a bigger space cooling then turn towards split air conditioners online as these accumulate more space but gives more cooling. Take measurements before you begin your purchase, for example, that about 12,000 BTUs are enough to freeze 350 square feet of space throughout the day. Window air conditioner consists of a compressor, evaporator, and condenser.\n\nWhy Choose Window AC over Split AC?\n\nBasically it is the old version of the modern split air conditioner you are accustomed to see around the electronic sphere. What sets the two models apart is the design and installation (function). Window air conditioner is fixed when its cooling fins are facing indoors, but the heating unit is kept on the opposing side. Firstly, the inner compartments contains fans at the front with evaporators behind and its filter in the middle that’s operated via the central control panel. Secondly, the condenser along with the compressor is mashed in a box that is kept outward for noise reduction and of course to minimize the space. Almost equally powerful – as explained above – a 1 ton air conditioner in Pakistan is available according to the home and office requirement of any consumer."

      "Product Description\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX?\n\nEnergy-Saver PC9 Air Conditioner; Free Igloo Tent (Worth Rs. 6,000); Warranty Card; English/Urdu User Manual and Getting Started Guide\n\nDescription\n\nRevolutionary Australian energy-saving technology.\n\nEconomy\n\nSave up to 85% on power costs by creating a comfortable micro-climate around you. Pay only Rs 1000 – 1500 a month for electricity.\n\nRoom air conditioners waste 90% of more of the cooling power on walls, floors, furniture, Close Comfort uses only 300 Watts, less than four light bulbs.\n\nIt’s affordable, good for ecology, economy and the environment.\n\nComfort\n\nSoft, focused cool air for comfort. The Igloo tent provides so much space around you.\n\nWake truly refreshed because you sleep through load shedding in fresh air from open windows.\n\nClose Comfort provides a soft focused flow of cool air to provide personal comfort and is almost silent. It works best with doors and windows open and fresh air for personal well-being.\n\nClose Comfort works in any size of room, even outside in sheltered places. Set up Close Comfort on your roof during the hottest m in summer and sleep under the stars!\n\nConvenience\n\nClose Comfort is portable and ready to use out of the box: just connect it to the nearest power outlet. Only 17 kg, it requires no installation, no water tank, and no pipe to the window.\n\nMinimal maintenance: just check the filters every two weeks. No consumables, no water, no ice, no recharging.\n\nPower\n\n1.2 kVA UPS recommended, 120 Amp-hour battery set.\n\nCooling Power\n\nRated cooling power is 0.25 ton, 2500-3500 BTU/hour. This air conditioner provides localized cooling where it is needed.\n\nNormal room air conditioners provide more cooling power, and can cool a whole room, but require 4-8 times as much electricity to run. Beware of the electricity cost which will be much higher."

      "Product details of General Vodacon0.75 Ton Window Air Conditioner with Remote Control - White\n\nSpecifications ofWindow Air Conditioner With Remote Control - 0.75Ton - White\nOld But Not Obsolete Window Air Conditioner\n\nOne of the cheapest solutions for home cooling is to find afunctionoverquality. Besides, an ideal windowair conditioneravailable online in Pakistan should function between 9,000 to 14,000 BTUs on the upside. Its costs less, yet it benefits in the long term and the installation process is adequately simple. Multiple factors such as design, the right size, and brand carry additional aspects that is directly depended in the space provided for cooling.\n\nBest Air Conditioner Online in Pakistan\n\nHave you considered the idea to buy 1 ton air conditioner in Pakistan if your need is to cool a single room? Whereas, if the solution requires for a bigger space cooling then turn towards split air conditioners online as these accumulate more space but gives more cooling. Take measurements before you begin your purchase, for example, that about 9,000 BTUs are enough to freeze 350 square feet of space throughout the day. Window air conditioner consists of a compressor, evaporator, and condenser.\n\nWhy Choose Window AC over Split AC?\n\nBasically it is the old version of the modernsplit air conditioneryou are accustomed to see around the electronic sphere. What sets the two models apart is the design and installation (function). Window air conditioner is fixed when its cooling fins are facing indoors, but the heating unit is kept on the opposing side. Firstly, the inner compartments contains fans at the front with evaporators behind and its filter in the middle that’s operated via the central control panel. Secondly, the condenser along with the compressor is mashed in a box that is kept outward for noise reduction and of course to minimize the space.\n\nAlmost equally powerful – as explained above – a 1 ton air conditioner in Pakistan is available according to the home and office requirement of any consumer."

      ": Inverter technology works on the concept of variable compressor speed. The compressor takes start at currents as low as 1.0 amperes. The compressor speed then goes up to it’s maximum and then decreases as the temprature is maintained inside the room. In ideal conditions, it saves upto 60% electricity. The cooling gas used inside is R410 which is approximately 20% more effecient both in terms of cooling and electricity saving. Moreover, the compressor takes start at voltages as low as 160V. This technology is ideal for places where generators are used as back up."

      "Triangle Design For Powerful Cooling The Samsung Air Conditioner's unique triangular design improves its performance, circulating cool air faster, farther and wider* around your home. Its Digital Inverter also provides significantly greater energy efficiency.** And its Virus Doctor and Easy Filter eliminates dust, contaminants, allergens, bacteria and viruses*** - firstly using a filter and secondly with Virus Doctor. * Tested on AR09HSFSBWK model. Compared with Samsung conventional model AQV09TWS. ** Tested on AR09HSSDAWK/EU. Compared with Samsung conventional model AQ09TSB. *** Tested in Kitasato Environmental Science Center (Japan) & Yonsei Univ.(Korea) / Korea test lab(FITI/KEMTI) and Japan test lab(ITEA). Effective on 4 viruses, including Subtype H1N1, and certain bacteria. Data has been measured under specific testing conditions and may differ based on environmental factors. Cools Faster, Farther, and Wider The Samsung Air Conditioner has been designed from the ground up to be outstandingly efficient. Its uniquely triangular design has a wider inlet, so more air can be drawn in. The improved width and angle of its outlet, extra v-blades and a bigger fan also ensure that air is cooled and expelled faster, farther and wider*. So refreshingly cool air reaches every corner of your room. * Tested on AR09HSFSBWK model. Compared with Samsung conventional model AQV09TWS. Cools You Fast Then Cools You Comfortably The Samsung Air Conditioner begins cooling the air fast using its powerful Fast Cool mode, so it gets there quickly. It then automatically changes the mode to Comfort Cool to maintain the desired temperature. So you won't feel cold and don't have to keep manually changing the settings or turning the Air Conditioner on and off. Works Smart. Saves Energy The Samsung Air Conditioner features an energy-efficient Digital Inverter with EER 10.1. It can maintain the desired temperature without frequently shutting off and on, so it consumes less energy. The Digital Inverter helps you to stay comfortable for long periods of time, while using the minimum amount of energy *. * Tested on AR09HSSDAWK/EU. Compared with Samsung conventional model AQ09TSB Save Energy Even When Alone The Samsung Air Conditioner's Single User mode uses less compressor capacity, reducing power consumption*, while still providing a cool and comfortable environment. So you can use it when you're alone, even during a hot day, without worrying about the electricity bill. * Tested on AR09FSSSCWK/SA. Based on accumulated power consumption of normal mode vs. single user mode Eliminates Viruses Virus Doctor and Easy Filter eliminates dust, dangerous airborne contaminants and allergens, as well as bacteria and viruses, including the Influenza A and Corona viruses* – firstly using a filter and secondly with Virus Doctor. So it keeps the air you breathe clean and healthy. * Tested in Kitasato Environmental Science Center (Japan) & Yonsei Univ.(Korea) / Korea test lab(FITI/KEMTI) and Japan test lab(ITEA). Effective on 4 viruses, including Subtype H1N1, and certain bacteria. Data has been measured under specific testing conditions and may differ based on environmental factors. Stable, Long-lasting Performance The Samsung Air Conditioner keeps going in the most challenging environments. Its Triple Protector Plus technology prevents the compressor and controller from being overloaded by power surges and fluctuating electrical currents, without a separate voltage stabilizer. It also has an anti-corrosive coating to stop the condenser from corrosion, and cabinet from rusting. And its larger condenser and optimized refrigerant flow mean it can endure extremely hot temperatures (up to 58 ºC) *. * Tested on AR09HPSDDWK/SG. Compared with Samsung conventional model AR09HPSDFAP/RC Easy to Take Out and Clean Unlike conventional filters that are often difficult to access, the Samsung Air Conditioner's Easy Filter is located outside, on the top. So it can easily be taken out, cleaned and put back – without having to open a cover or pull hard to get it out. And its anti-bacterial coating filters dust, dangerous airborne contaminants and allergens.* * Tested in Korea test lab(FITI/KEMTI) and Japan test lab(ITEA). Data has been measured under specific testing conditions and may differ based on environmental factors. Smartly Convenient With the Samsung Air Conditioner you can enjoy the confidence that it's perfectly installed and the convenience of remote control and trouble-shooting. Smart Installation checks for common problems to make sure it is properly installed. Using an App on your smartphone, Smart Wi-Fi lets you monitor and change energy settings from anywhere and Smart Check lets you diagnose errors and request a service immediately. Ensure Proper Installation Smart Installation is a self-diagnosis feature that ensures your Samsung Air Conditioner is installed perfectly by your service engineer. It automatically checks for installation faults that can cause problems when using the air conditioner, including ineffective communication with the outdoor unit, any issues with the integrity of the air pipe and poor refrigerant flow. Control It Anywhere Using an App* on your smartphone the Smart Wi-Fi function lets you remotely control the functions of the Samsung Air Conditioner and schedule its operation. In any location with a wireless network, you can instantly turn it on and off and select the operating mode and temperature. Or you can schedule when to start and stop and control other functions. * Available on iPhones and Android devices. Easy Troubleshooting The Samsung Air Conditioner includes Smart Check, an automatic error-monitoring system. It detects and diagnoses problems at an early stage and provides quick and easy troubleshooting solutions using a smartphone App*. So it saves you time having to find the manual and avoids the cost and inconvenience of unnecessary engineer callouts** – and potentially expensive repair bills. * Available on iPhones and Android devices. ** This function operates for certain error mode only and is not substitute for periodic service checkup.

      "Product details of General Firtina 0.75 Ton Window Air Conditioner with Remote Control - White\n\nSpecifications ofWindow Air Conditioner With Remote Control - 0.75 Ton - White\nOld But Not Obsolete Window Air Conditioner\n\nOne of the cheapest solutions for home cooling is to find afunctionoverquality. Besides, an ideal windowair conditioneravailable online in Pakistan should function between 9,000 to 14,000 BTUs on the upside. Its costs less, yet it benefits in the long term and the installation process is adequately simple. Multiple factors such as design, the right size, and brand carry additional aspects that is directly depended in the space provided for cooling.\n\nBest Air Conditioner Online in Pakistan\n\nHave you considered the idea to buy 1 ton air conditioner in Pakistan if your need is to cool a single room? Whereas, if the solution requires for a bigger space cooling then turn towards split air conditioners online as these accumulate more space but gives more cooling. Take measurements before you begin your purchase, for example, that about 8,000 BTUs are enough to freeze 350 square feet of space throughout the day. Window air conditioner consists of a compressor, evaporator, and condenser.\n\nWhy Choose Window AC over Split AC?\n\nBasically it is the old version of the modernsplit air conditioneryou are accustomed to see around the electronic sphere. What sets the two models apart is the design and installation (function). Window air conditioner is fixed when its cooling fins are facing indoors, but the heating unit is kept on the opposing side. Firstly, the inner compartments contains fans at the front with evaporators behind and its filter in the middle that’s operated via the central control panel. Secondly, the condenser along with the compressor is mashed in a box that is kept outward for noise reduction and of course to minimize the space.\n\nAlmost equally powerful – as explained above – a 1 ton air conditioner in Pakistan is available according to the home and office requirement of any consumer."

      "Product details of Skywood Cool SKW-09R 0.75 Ton Window Air Conditioner\nWindow Air Conditioner\nOne of the cheapest solutions for home cooling is to find afunctionoverquality. Besides, an ideal window air conditioner available online in Pakistan should function between 9,000 to 14,000 BTUs on the upside. Its costs less, yet it benefits in the long term and the installation process is adequately simple. Multiple factors such as design, the right size, and brand carry additional aspects that is directly depended in the space provided for cooling.\nBest Air Conditioner Online in Pakistan\nHave you considered the idea to buy 1 ton air conditioner in Pakistan if your need is to cool a single room? Whereas, if the solution requires for a bigger space cooling then turn towards split air conditioners online as these accumulate more space but gives more cooling. Take measurements before you begin your purchase, for example, that about 8,000 BTUs are enough to freeze 350 square feet of space throughout the day. Window air conditioner consists of a compressor, evaporator, and condenser.\nWhy Choose Window AC over Split AC?\nBasically it is the old version of the modern split air conditioner you are accustomed to see around the electronic sphere. What sets the two models apart is the design and installation (function). Window air conditioner is fixed when its cooling fins are facing indoors, but the heating unit is kept on the opposing side. Firstly, the inner compartments contains fans at the front with evaporators behind and its filter in the middle that’s operated via the central control panel. Secondly, the condenser along with the compressor is mashed in a box that is kept outward for noise reduction and of course to minimize the space. Almost equally powerful – as explained above – a 0.75 ton air conditioner in Pakistan is available according to the home and office requirement of any consumer."

Fast, comfortable operation and amazingly low running cost -That's the Mitu Electric promise.\n\nINVERTERS - HOW THEY WORK\n\nInverters electronically control the electrical voltage, current and frequency of electrical devices such as the compressor motor in an air conditioner. They receive information from sensors monitoring operating conditions, and adjust the revolution speed of the compressor, which directly regulates air conditioner output. Optimum control of operation frequency results in eliminating the consumption of excessive electricity and providing the most comfortable room environment."

      "Product details of Skywood Cool SKW-09R Window Air Conditioner - 0.75 Ton\n\n \n\nSpecifications of Cool SKW-09R Window Air Conditioner - 0.75 Ton\nWindow Air Conditioner\n\nOne of the cheapest solutions for home cooling is to find afunction over quality. Besides, an ideal window air conditioner available online in Pakistan should function between 9,000 to 14,000 BTUs on the upside. Its costs less, yet it benefits in the long term and the installation process is adequately simple. Multiple factors such as design, the right size, and brand carry additional aspects that is directly depended in the space provided for cooling.\n\nBest Air Conditioner Online in Pakistan\n\nHave you considered the idea to buy 1 ton air conditioner in Pakistan if your need is to cool a single room? Whereas, if the solution requires for a bigger space cooling then turn towards split air conditioners online as these accumulate more space but gives more cooling. Take measurements before you begin your purchase, for example, that about 8,000 BTUs are enough to freeze 350 square feet of space throughout the day. Window air conditioner consists of a compressor, evaporator, and condenser.\n\nWhy Choose Window AC over Split AC?\n\nBasically it is the old version of the modern split air conditioner you are accustomed to see around the electronic sphere. What sets the two models apart is the design and installation (function). Window air conditioner is fixed when its cooling fins are facing indoors, but the heating unit is kept on the opposing side. Firstly, the inner compartments contains fans at the front with evaporators behind and its filter in the middle that’s operated via the central control panel. Secondly, the condenser along with the compressor is mashed in a box that is kept outward for noise reduction and of course to minimize the space.\n\nAlmost equally powerful – as explained above – a 0.75 ton air conditioner in Pakistan is available according to the home and office requirement of any consumer.\n\nSpecifications of SkyWood Cool SKW-09R Window Air Conditioner - 0.75 Ton White"

      "Product details of General Firtina 0.75 Ton Window Air Conditioner with Remote Control - White\n\nSpecifications of Window Air Conditioner With Remote Control - 0.75 Ton - White\nOld But Not Obsolete Window Air Conditioner\n\nOne of the cheapest solutions for home cooling is to find afunctionoverquality. Besides, an ideal windowair conditioner available online in Pakistan should function between 9,000 to 14,000 BTUs on the upside. Its costs less, yet it benefits in the long term and the installation process is adequately simple. Multiple factors such as design, the right size, and brand carry additional aspects that is directly depended in the space provided for cooling.\n\nBest Air Conditioner Online in Pakistan\n\nHave you considered the idea to buy 1 ton air conditioner in Pakistan if your need is to cool a single room? Whereas, if the solution requires for a bigger space cooling then turn towards split air conditioners online as these accumulate more space but gives more cooling. Take measurements before you begin your purchase, for example, that about 8,000 BTUs are enough to freeze 350 square feet of space throughout the day. Window air conditioner consists of a compressor, evaporator, and condenser.\n\nWhy Choose Window AC over Split AC?\n\nBasically it is the old version of the modern split air conditioner you are accustomed to see around the electronic sphere. What sets the two models apart is the design and installation (function). Window air conditioner is fixed when its cooling fins are facing indoors, but the heating unit is kept on the opposing side. Firstly, the inner compartments contains fans at the front with evaporators behind and its filter in the middle that’s operated via the central control panel. Secondly, the condenser along with the compressor is mashed in a box that is kept outward for noise reduction and of course to minimize the space.\n\nAlmost equally powerful – as explained above – a 1 ton air conditioner in Pakistan is available according to the home and office requirement of any consumer."

      "Green Air Inverter efficiently controls the voltage current and frequency of compressor motor. The sensors monitor operating conditions and adjust the revolution speed of the compressor which directly regulates air condition output. Optimum control of operation frequency results in eliminating the consumption of excessive electricity and providing the most comfortable room environment. The Inverter technology (DC) is the latest evolution of technology concerning the electro motors of the compressors. An Inverter is used to control the speed of the compressor motor, so as to continuously regulate the temperature. A microcontroller can sample each ambient air temperature and adjust accordingly the speed of the compressor. The inverter air conditioning units have increased efficiency in contraction to traditional air conditioners, extended life of their parts and the sharp fluctuations in the load are eliminated. This makes the inverter AC units quieter, with lower operating cost and with less broke downs.Buy this efficient and high performing AC from Daraz.pk only.\n"

Data has been measured under specific testing conditions and may differ based on environmental factors.The Samsung Air Conditioner has been designed from the ground up to be outstandingly efficient. Its uniquely triangular design has a wider inlet, so more air can be drawn in. The improved width and angle of its outlet, extra v-blades and a bigger fan also ensure that air is cooled and expelled faster, farther and wider*. So refreshingly cool air reaches every corner of your room. * Tested on AR09HSFSBWK model. Compared with Samsung conventional model AQV09TWS.The Samsung Air Conditioner begins cooling the air fast using its powerful Fast Cool mode, so it gets there quickly. It then automatically changes the mode to Comfort Cool to maintain the desired temperature. So you won’t feel cold and don’t have to keep manually changing the settings or turning the Air Conditioner on and off.With Single User mode, you don’t have to repeatedly turn the Samsung Air Conditioner on and off to save energy or worry about using it if it’s not unbearably hot. Inthis mode, the compressor and fan only run long enough to maintain the desired temperature and automatically shut off when they’re not needed. So it uses much less electricity * – keeping your bills low and your rooms cool. * Tested on AR12HPSDDWK. Based on accumulated power consumption of normal mode vs. single user modeVirus Doctor and Easy Filter eliminates dust, dangerous airborne contaminants and allergens, as well as bacteria and viruses, including the Influenza A and Corona viruses* – firstly using a filter and secondly with Virus Doctor. So it keeps the air you breathe clean and healthy. * Tested in Kitasato Environmental Science Center (Japan) & Yonsei Univ.(Korea) / Korea test lab(FITI/KEMTI) and Japan test lab(ITEA).

      "Product details of Imported DC Inverter 0.75 Ton Portable Air Conditioner \n\n \n\nSpecifications of Cool Imported DC Inverter - 0.75 Ton Portable Air Conditioner \nPortable Air Conditioner\n\nOne of the cheapest solutions for home cooling is to find afunction over quality. Besides, an ideal window air conditioner available online in Pakistan should function between 9,000 to 14,000 BTUs on the upside. Its costs less, yet it benefits in the long term and the installation process is adequately simple. Multiple factors such as design, the right size, and brand carry additional aspects that is directly depended in the space provided for cooling.\n\nBest Air Conditioner Online in Pakistan\n\nHave you considered the idea to buy 1 ton air conditioner in Pakistan if your need is to cool a single room? Whereas, if the solution requires for a bigger space cooling then turn towards split air conditioners online as these accumulate more space but gives more cooling. Take measurements before you begin your purchase, for example, that about 8,000 BTUs are enough to freeze 350 square feet of space throughout the day. Window air conditioner consists of a compressor, evaporator, and condenser.\n\nWhy Choose Window AC over Split AC?\n\nBasically it is the old version of the modern split air conditioner you are accustomed to see around the electronic sphere. What sets the two models apart is the design and installation (function). Window air conditioner is fixed when its cooling fins are facing indoors, but the heating unit is kept on the opposing side. Firstly, the inner compartments contains fans at the front with evaporators behind and its filter in the middle that’s operated via the central control panel. Secondly, the condenser along with the compressor is mashed in a box that is kept outward for noise reduction and of course to minimize the space.\n\nAlmost equally powerful – as explained above – a 0.75 ton air conditioner in Pakistan is available according to the home and office requirement of any consumer."

      "Description:\nTriangle Design For Powerful Cooling:\n\nThe Samsung Air Conditioner's unique triangular design improves its performance, circulating cool air faster, farther and wider* around your home. Its Digital Inverter also provides significantly greater energy efficiency.** And its Virus Doctor and Easy Filter eliminates dust, contaminants, allergens, bacteria and viruses*** - firstly using a filter and secondly with Virus Doctor.\n\nTested on AR09HSFSBWK model. Compared with Samsung conventional model AQV09TWS. ** Tested on AR09HSSDAWK/EU. Compared with Samsung conventional model AQ09TSB. *** Tested in Kitasato Environmental Science Center (Japan) & Yonsei Univ.(Korea) / Korea test lab(FITI/KEMTI) and Japan test lab(ITEA). Effective on 4 viruses, including Subtype H1N1, and certain bacteria. Data has been measured under specific testing conditions and may differ based on environmental factors.\n\nCools Faster, Farther, and Wider:\n\nThe Samsung Air Conditioner has been designed from the ground up to be outstandingly efficient. Its uniquely triangular design has a wider inlet, so more air can be drawn in. The improved width and angle of its outlet, extra v-blades and a bigger fan also ensure that air is cooled and expelled faster, farther and wider*. So refreshingly cool air reaches every corner of your room.\n\n* Tested on AR09HSFSBWK model. Compared with Samsung conventional model AQV09TWS.\n\nCools You Fast Then Cools You Comfortably:\n\nThe Samsung Air Conditioner begins cooling the air fast using its powerful Fast Cool mode, so it gets there quickly. It then automatically changes the mode to Comfort Cool to maintain the desired temperature. So you won't feel cold and don't have to keep manually changing the settings or turning the Air Conditioner on and off.\n\nWorks Smart. Saves Energy:\n\nThe Samsung Air Conditioner features an energy-efficient Digital Inverter with EER 10.1. It can maintain the desired temperature without frequently shutting off and on, so it consumes less energy. The Digital Inverter helps you to stay comfortable for long periods of time, while using the minimum amount of energy *.\n\n* Tested on AR09HSSDAWK/EU. Compared with Samsung conventional model AQ09TSB\n\nSave Energy Even When Alone:\n\nThe Samsung Air Conditioner's Single User mode uses less compressor capacity, reducing power consumption*, while still providing a cool and comfortable environment. So you can use it when you're alone, even during a hot day, without worrying about the electricity bill.\n\n* Tested on AR09FSSSCWK/SA. Based on accumulated power consumption of normal mode vs. single user mode\n\nStable, Long-lasting Performance:\n\nThe Samsung Air Conditioner keeps going in the most challenging environments. Its Triple Protector Plus technology prevents the compressor and controller from being overloaded by power surges and fluctuating electrical currents, without a separate voltage stabilizer. It also has an anti-corrosive coating to stop the condenser from corrosion, and cabinet from rusting. And its larger condenser and optimized refrigerant flow mean it can endure extremely hot temperatures (up to 58 ºC) *."

      "Outstandingly efficient!\nEven it’s just beginning of May temperature in Pakistan can be harsh. In all such circumstances, get a save from the lethal heat countrywide. Air conditioners are a necessity in today’s time as they save you from the tormenting weather in summers and allow you to lead a comfortable life. After a tiring day at work, relaxing in your room with the air conditioner on is all that you will ask for. If you are looking forward to purchase an air conditioner and are confused between which product to go for, choose ES 30 - Energy Saver Split Air Conditioner to make your life easier.\n\nCools Faster, Farther, and Wider\nDesigned to be outstandingly efficient. Its unique design has a wider inlet, so more air can be drawn in. The improved width and angle of its outlet, extra blades and a bigger fan also ensure that air is cooled and expelled faster, farther and wider. So refreshingly cool air reaches every corner of your room.\n\nSave Energy Even When Alone\nIt uses less compressor capacity, reducing power consumption, while still providing a cool and comfortable environment. So you can use it when you’re alone, even during a hot day, without worrying about the electricity bill. \n\n\n\n\nEasy to Take Out and Clean\nUnlike conventional filters that are often difficult to access, this easy filter is located outside, on the top. So it can easily be taken out, cleaned and put back – without having to open a cover or pull hard to get it out. And its anti-bacterial coating filters dust, dangerous airborne contaminants and allergens.\n\nSpecifications\nFashionable design to match your interior\nSleep mode function- for comfortable sleep\nAuto-restart function\nWeight 1.5 Ton\nCapacity 18000BTU\n*Warranty Claimable for the Products sold by Dawlance\nUAN: 03-111-11-7359(RELY)\ncustomer.service@dawlance.com.pk\"\nWarranty Claimable for products only sold by SZE\n17-Lawrence Road Lahore.

The develop technology benefit both the environment and you electricity bill, so your intentions don’t have to prevent you from living a confortable life\n\nR-32 is a new refrigerant currently receiving the most interest. Because R-32 efficiently conveys heat, it can reduce electricity consumption up to approximately 30% compared to that of air conditioners using refrigerant R-22. Furthermore, compared to the refrigerants widely used today such as R-22 and R-410A, R-32 has a global warming potential (GWP) that is one-third lower and is remarkable for its low environmental impact. Moreover the cooling capacity of R-32 is also 20% more as compared R-410A, this is the reason why in coming years R-32 is going to be the primary refrigerant of choice in HVAC industry and this what most of the manufacturers are leaning towards. Eminent Air is first brand to launch in pakistan with R-32 technology.\n\nMake: Thailand"

      "Inverter Technology\nAir conditioner operation is controlled to achieve a considerable reduction in power consumption, maintaining a pleasant room temperature. Inverter air conditioners on full output operation mode, drastically reduce energy consumption when used in energy saving operation mode. Thanks to inverter circuitry, this modifies and maintains room temperature by switching the compressor between high and low operation modes, instead of switching it on and off completely as non-inverter models do. The inverter model keeps the compressor running and simply reduces output when the room reaches the target temperature, enabling comfortable, even temperature control.\nPlasma cluster technology generates and releases the same positive and negative ions that occur in nature\nPlasmacluster Mechanism to Remove Microbes\n• Ions are released into the Air• The ions act on airborne microbes such as Viruses and Bacteria deactivate them. • The broken-down components return to the air as water\nSharp’s unique “Nature Wing” fan blades modeled after nature for increased circulation efficiency\nDragon fly wings reduce air frictionA Dragon's wings have ridged surfaces that generate miniscule air eddies during flight. These eddies function like ball bearings to make flight smoother with less effort. The cross flow fans in indoor units feature blades modeled on this shape, which optimally harnesses the flow of air to boost air circulation efficiency.Air circulation efficiency increased by 30%\nAlbatross wings—ideal for long-distance flightAmong all birds, the albatross has the greatest gliding power and can stay aloft continuously for tens of thousands of kilometers. It can do this thanks to its narrow, pointed planar wings. This wing design is applied to the fan blades in outdoor units. The air eddies generated around the fan are made smaller, minimizing air resistance and boosting air circulation efficiency.Air circulation efficiency boosted by approx. 20%\n\n\nFeatures\n\nPlasmacluster Ions\nPowerful Jet\nGentle Cool Air System\nAuto Swing\nSelf-Cleaning Function\nQuiet Operation\nAvailable Capacity\n24,000 Btu (50Hz)\nMade in Thailand\n\nSpecifications\n\nCapacity (Btu/Hr)  : 21325\nVoltage Range (v) : 220-240\nRunning Current  (A): 8.9\nPower Input (W) : 1800\nEER : 11.85\nDimension WxHxD :  Indoor  (1006 X 316 X 249), Outdoor (850 X 710 X 330)\nStandard Pipe length: 5 m\nMaximum pipe length: 15 m\nRefrigerant: R410A\nCompressor type: Rotary"

      "InverterTechnology\n\nAir conditioner operation is controlled to achieve a considerable reduction in power consumption, maintaining a pleasant roomtemperature. Inverter air conditioners on full output operation mode, drastically reduce energy consumption when used in energy saving operation mode.\n\nThanks to inverter circuitry, this modifies and maintains room temperature by switching the compressor between high and low operation modes, instead of switching it on and off completely as non-inverter models do.\n\nThe inverter model keeps the compressor running and simply reduces output when the room reaches the target temperature,enabling comfortable, even temperature control.\n\nSharp’s\nunique “Nature Wing” fan blades modeled after nature for increased circulation efficiency\n\nDragon fly wings\nreduce air friction\n\nA Dragon's wings have ridged surfaces that generate minuscule air eddies during flight. These eddies function like ball bearings to make flight smoother with less effort. The cross flow fans in indoor units feature blades modeled on this shape, which optimally harnesses the flow of air to boost air circulation efficiency.\n\nAir circulation efficiency increased by 30%\n\nAlbatross wings—ideal\nfor long-distance flight\n\nAmong all birds, the albatross has the greatest gliding power and can stay aloft continuously for tens of thousands of kilometers. It can do this thanks to its narrow, pointed planar wings. This wing design is applied to the fan blades in outdoor units. The air eddies generated around the fan are made smaller, minimizing air resistance and boosting air circulationefficiency.\nAir circulation efficiency boosted by approx 20%\n\nFeatures\n\nSuper jet\nGentle Cool Air System\nInstant Low Wattage\nAll-aluminum Heat Exchanger\nAuto Swing\nSelf-Cleaning Function\nAvailable Capacity\n18,000 Btu (50Hz)\nMade in Thailand\n\nSpecifications\n\nCapacity (Btu/Hr)  : 17094\nVoltage Range (v) : 220-240\nRunning Current  (A): 7.0\nPower Input (W) : 1480\nEER : 11.55\nDimension WxHxD :  Indoor  (1006 X 316 X 249), Outdoor (780 X 540 X 269)\nStandard Pipe length: 5 m\nMaximum pipe length: 15 m\nRefrigerant: R410A\nCompressor type: Rotary"

Besides, an ideal Portableair conditioneravailable online in Pakistan should function between 9,000 to 14,000 BTUs on the upside. Its costs less, yet it benefits in the long term and the installation process is adequately simple. Multiple factors such as design, the right size, and brand carry additional aspects that is directly depended in the space provided for cooling.\n\nBest Air Conditioner Online in Pakistan\n\nHave you considered the idea to buy 1 ton air conditioner in Pakistan if your need is to cool a single room? Whereas, if the solution requires for a bigger space cooling then turn towards split air conditioners online as these accumulate more space but gives more cooling. Take measurements before you begin your purchase, for example, that about 8,000 BTUs are enough to freeze 350 square feet of space throughout the day. Portable air conditioner consists of a compressor, evaporator, and condenser.\n\nWhy Choose Portable AC over Split AC?\n\nBasically it is the old version of the modernsplit air conditioneryou are accustomed to see around the electronic sphere. What sets the two models apart is the design and installation (function). Portable air conditioner is fixed when its cooling fins are facing indoors, but the heating unit is kept on the opposing side. Firstly, the inner compartments contains fans at the front with evaporators behind and its filter in the middle that’s operated via the central control panel. Secondly, the condenser along with the compressor is mashed in a box that is kept outward for noise reduction and of course to minimize the space.\n\nAlmost equally powerful – as explained above – a 1 ton air conditioner in Pakistan is available according to the home and office requirement of any consumer.\n\nSpecifications of SkyWoodCool SKP-1224HWBDC Inverter 1 Ton PortableAir ConditionerWhite"

      "Inverter\nTechnology\n\nAir conditioner operation is controlled to achieve a considerable reduction in power consumption, maintaining a pleasant room\ntemperature. Inverter air conditioners on full output operation mode, drastically reduce energy consumption when used in energy saving operation mode.\n\nThanks to inverter circuitry, this modifies and maintains room temperature by switching the compressor between high and low operation modes, instead of switching it on and off completely as non-inverter models do.\n\nThe inverter model keeps the compressor running and simply reduces output when the room reaches the target temperature,\nenabling comfortable, even temperature control.\n\nSharp’s\nunique “Nature Wing” fan blades modeled after nature for increased circulation efficiency\n\nDragon fly wings\nreduce air friction\n\nA Dragon's wings have ridged surfaces that generate miniscule air eddies during flight. These eddies function like ball bearings to make flight smoother with less effort. The cross flow fans in indoor units feature blades modeled on this shape, which optimally harnesses the flow of air to boost air circulation efficiency.\n\nAir circulation efficiency increased by 30%\n\nAlbatross wings—ideal\nfor long-distance flight\n\nAmong all birds, the albatross has the greatest gliding power and can stay aloft continuously for tens of thousands of kilometers. It can do this thanks to its narrow, pointed planar wings. This wing design is applied to the fan blades in outdoor units. The air eddies generated around the fan are made smaller, minimizing air resistance and boosting air circulation\nefficiency.\n\nAir circulation efficiency boosted by approx 20%\n\nFeatures:\n\nPowerful Jet\nGentle Cool Air System\nAuto Swing\nQuiet Operation\nAuto Restart\nAvailable Capacity\n12,000 Btu (50Hz)\nMade in Thailand\n\nSpecifications\n\nCapacity (Btu/Hr)  : 11942\nVoltage Range (v) : 220-240\nRunning Current  (A): 6.1\nPower Input (W) : 1060\nEER : 11.27\nDimension WxHxD :  Indoor  (877 X 292 X 222), Outdoor (730 X 540 X 250)\nStandard Pipe length: 5 m\nMaximum pipe length: 15 m\nRefrigerant: R410A\nCompressor type: Rotary"

      "Green Air Inverter efficiently controls the voltage current and frequency of compressor motor. The sensors monitor operating conditions and adjust the revolution speed of the compressor which directly regulates air condition output. Optimum control of operation frequency results in eliminating the consumption of excessive electricity and providing the most comfortable room environment. The Inverter technology (DC) is the latest evolution of technology concerning the electro motors of the compressors. An Inverter is used to control the speed of the compressor motor, so as to continuously regulate the temperature. A microcontroller can sample each ambient air temperature and adjust accordingly the speed of the compressor. The inverter air conditioning units have increased efficiency in contraction to traditional air conditioners, extended life of their parts and the sharp fluctuations in the load are eliminated. This makes the inverter AC units quieter, with lower operating cost and with less broke downs.Buy this efficient and high performing AC from Daraz.pk only.\n"

      "Refreshingly cool air!\nEven it’s just beginning of May temperature in Pakistan can be harsh. In all such circumstances, get a save from the lethal heat countrywide. Air conditioners are a necessity in today’s time as they save you from the tormenting weather in summers and allow you to lead a comfortable life. After a tiring day at work, relaxing in your room with the air conditioner on is all that you will ask for. If you are looking forward to purchase an air conditioner and are confused between which product to go for, choose Inspire-15 Series Split Air Conditioner to make your life easier.\n\nCools Faster, Farther, and Wider\nDesigned to be outstandingly efficient. Its unique design has a wider inlet, so more air can be drawn in. The improved width and angle of its outlet, extra blades and a bigger fan also ensure that air is cooled and expelled faster, farther and wider. So refreshingly cool air reaches every corner of your room.\nSave Energy Even When Alone\nIt uses less compressor capacity, reducing power consumption, while still providing a cool and comfortable environment. So you can use it when you’re alone, even during a hot day, without worrying about the electricity bill. \nEasy to Take Out and Clean\nUnlike conventional filters that are often difficult to access, this easy filter is located outside, on the top. So it can easily be taken out, cleaned and put back – without having to open a cover or pull hard to get it out. And its anti-bacterial coating filters dust, dangerous airborne contaminants and allergens.\nSpecifications:\nElegant Design with Hidden Display\nTurbo mode for quick cooling\nWide angle swing\nWeight: 1 Ton\nCapacity: 12000 BTU\nRoom Size (minimum): 125 sqft\nRoom Size (maximum): 150 sqft\n*Warranty Claimable for the Products sold by Dawlance\nUAN: 03-111-11-7359(RELY)customer.service@dawlance.com.pk\"\nWarranty Claimable for products only sold by SZE\n17-Lawrence Road Lahore.

      "Outstandingly efficient!\n\nEven it’s just beginning of May temperature in Pakistan can be harsh. In all such circumstances, get a save from the lethal heat countrywide. Air conditioners are a necessity in today’s time as they save you from the tormenting weather in summers and allow you to lead a comfortable life. After a tiring day at work, relaxing in your room with the air conditioner on is all that you will ask for. If you are looking forward to purchase an air conditioner and are confused between which product to go for, choose H Zone 30 - 1.5 ton Air Conditioner to make your life easier.\n\nCools Faster, Farther, and Wider\n\nDesigned to be outstandingly efficient. Its unique design has a wider inlet, so more air can be drawn in. The improved width and angle of its outlet, extra blades and a bigger fan also ensure that air is cooled and expelled faster, farther and wider. So refreshingly cool air reaches every corner of your room.\n\nSave Energy Even When Alone\n\nIt uses less compressor capacity, reducing power consumption, while still providing a cool and comfortable environment. So you can use it when you’re alone, even during a hot day, without worrying about the electricity bill. \n\nEasy to Take Out and Clean\n\nUnlike conventional filters that are often difficult to access, this easy filter is located outside, on the top. So it can easily be taken out, cleaned and put back – without having to open a cover or pull hard to get it out. And its anti-bacterial coating filters dust, dangerous airborne contaminants and allergens."

      "The Result of Anti Mosquito Function\n\nUp to 82% Malaria Mosquitos expelled in treatment. The ultrasonic device was able to knock down up to 64% of female Anopheles mosquitoes within 24 hrs in Peety Grady Chamber, and was able to expel up to 82% of female Anopheles mosquitoes. * The Knock-down test is conducted in 1.9m x 1.9m x1.9m chamber. (Official WHO standard) \n- Based on third-party testing, LG’s [HS-C096B4N7,HS-C126B4N1,HS-C186C4N4] can repel up to 82% of anopheles mosquitoes, known to transmit malaria. This product should not replace other mosquito prevention methods.

LG air conditioner is built to work just fine with African local issues such as unstable electrocity fluctuation or full of salt and sand particle environment. \nLow voltage starter\n\nDue to the unstable infrastructure, the supply of electricity is usually lower than the demand. This is more frequent during the hot summer when the usage of electricity is high. LG air conditioner even operates at lower voltage in lower temperatures. \nGold Fin\n\nLG’s Gold Fin anticorrosive aluminum coating is especially suitable for coastal areas where salt and sand particles create a more corrosive environment.  \nPower cooling & other features\n\nTitan create optimum living conditions with powerful cooling performance. Titan cools your room faster and optimizely distributes the airflow. Moreover, it can cover large space with 10m long airflow reach. \nQuick cooling\n\nJet Cool disperses air evenly at high speed for a prompt cooling that is 20% faster than the others. \n10m Wind Blast\n\nKeep cool this summer with the new larger fan and chassis that allow you to feel the air current up to 10 meters away. Now cooling is faster and more powerful, allowing you to feel comfortable sooner. \nQuick & Easy Installation\n\n\nLG air conditioners are designed to be easier and more efficient to be installed, regardless of the surroundings and the number of persons involved in the installation process. \nTriple Filter\n\nEliminates chemical particles and other odor emanating from different sources including tobacco. Warranty Claimable for products only sold by SZE\n17-Lawrence Road Lahore.

      "State of the Art Air Vane Technology\n\nApart from special structure design and microcomputer control, Orient air conditioner series owns unique rotary air vane technology. In cooling mode, air vane is opened counter clockwise. Cool air blows out horizontally and then falls down by gravitation. Thus room temperature is quickly and evenly achieved.\n\nLow Noise Air Flow System\n\nWithout decreasing the flow volume, the large diameter cross flow fan can greatly reduce the indoor unit's noise by lowering fan speed and thus creating a quiet and comfortable environment for you.\n\n\n\nSleep Mode\n\nThis function enables the unit to automatically increase (cooling) or decrease (heating) 1C per hour for the first two hours, then holds steady for the next 5 hours, before stopping its operation. It can maintain the most comfortable temperature and save energy.\n\n\n\nTurbo Mode\n\nThe turbo mode helps in achieving lowest temperatures in minimum time.\n\nAuto Restart Function\n\nWhen the power is off and then it gets on again the unit automatically restores the previous function settings.\n\n\n\nMulti-Bend Heat Exchanger\n\nCompared with conventional models, Orient air conditioners adopt multi-bend exchangers. It helps increase the heat exchange surface so that it improves efficiency.\n\n\n\nAuto Temperature Adjustment\n\nThe ceiling temperature is often higher than the floor temperature. This function can automatically eliminate the temperature difference between them.\n\n\n\nAnti Rust Cabinet\n\nMade from electrolytic zinc steel sheet and anti-rust coated components, Orient air conditioners' outdoor unit is rust-free even in areas near the seashore.\n\nWarranty Claimable for products only sold by SZE\n17-Lawrence Road Lahore.

      "\n\nThe Samsung Air Conditioner has been designed from the ground up to be outstandingly efficient. Its uniquely triangular design has a wider inlet, so more air can be drawn in. The improved width and angle of its outlet, extra v-blades and a bigger fan also ensure that air is cooled and expelled faster, farther and wider*. So refreshingly cool air reaches every corner of your room. * Tested on AR09HSFSBWK model. Compared with Samsung conventional model AQV09TWS.\nCools You Fast Then Cools You Comfortably\nThe Samsung Air Conditioner begins cooling the air fast using its powerful Fast Cool mode, so it gets there quickly. It then automatically changes the mode to Comfort Cool to maintain the desired temperature. So you won't feel cold and don't have to keep manually changing the settings or turning the Air Conditioner on and off.\nWorks Smart. Saves Energy\nThe Samsung Air Conditioner features an energy-efficient Digital Inverter with EER 10.1. It can maintain the desired temperature without frequently shutting off and on, so it consumes less energy. The Digital Inverter helps you to stay comfortable for long periods of time, while using the minimum amount of energy *. * Tested on AR09HSSDAWK/EU. Compared with Samsung conventional model AQ09TSB\nSave Energy Even When Alone\nThe Samsung Air Conditioner's Single User mode uses less compressor capacity, reducing power consumption*, while still providing a cool and comfortable environment. So you can use it when you're alone, even during a hot day, without worrying about the electricity bill. * Tested on AR09FSSSCWK/SA. Based on accumulated power consumption of normal mode vs. single user mode\nEliminates Viruses\nVirus Doctor and Easy Filter eliminates dust, dangerous airborne contaminants and allergens, as well as bacteria and viruses, including the Influenza A and Corona viruses* – firstly using a filter and secondly with Virus Doctor. So it keeps the air you breathe clean and healthy. * Tested in Kitasato Environmental Science Centre (Japan) & Yonsei Univ.(Korea) / Korea test lab(FITI/KEMTI) and Japan test lab(ITEA). Effective on 4 viruses, including Subtype H1N1, and certain bacteria. Data has been measured under specific testing conditionsv and may differ based on environmental factors.\nUniquely Stylish\n\nThe pure Crystal Gloss™ finish and uniquely curved design of the Samsung Air Conditioner deliver a premium look and performance. Like aerodynamic, high performance sports cars, every aspect of its streamlined body is encased in dual-injected, transparent material for an elegant finish that blends seamlessly into any modern household."

      "A necessity!\nEven it’s just beginning of May temperature in Pakistan can be harsh. In all such circumstances, get a save from the lethal heat countrywide. Air conditioners are a necessity in today’s time as they save you from the tormenting weather in summers and allow you to lead a comfortable life. After a tiring day at work, relaxing in your room with the air conditioner on is all that you will ask for. If you are looking forward to purchase an air conditioner and are confused between which product to go for, choose Signature-15 Series Split Air Conditioner to make your life easier.\nCools Faster, Farther, and Wider\nDesigned to be outstandingly efficient. Its unique design has a wider inlet, so more air can be drawn in. The improved width and angle of its outlet, extra blades and a bigger fan also ensure that air is cooled and expelled faster, farther and wider. So refreshingly cool air reaches every corner of your room.\n\nSave Energy Even When Alone\nIt uses less compressor capacity, reducing power consumption, while still providing a cool and comfortable environment. So you can use it when you’re alone, even during a hot day, without worrying about the electricity bill. \nEasy to Take Out and Clean\nUnlike conventional filters that are often difficult to access, this easy filter is located outside, on the top. So it can easily be taken out, cleaned and put back – without having to open a cover or pull hard to get it out. And its anti-bacterial coating filters dust, dangerous airborne contaminants and allergens.\nSpecifications\nHidden Display\nAnti Rust condenser\n3 mode operation: sleep mode, soft dry operation mode, cool mode\nAuto restart function\n12000BTU (1 Ton) Cooling Capacity\nFor room size: 125sqft (min.) - 150sqft (max.)\nWhite Color\n*Warranty Claimable for the Products sold by Dawlance\n\nUAN: 03-111-11-7359(RELY)customer.service@dawlance.com.pk\"\nWarranty Claimable for products only sold by SZE\n\n17-Lawrence Road Lahore.

      "Inner Grooved Copper Tube Technology\n\nBased on Japanese technology Inner-grooved Copper Tube gives instant cooling even in extreme temperatures of up to 53?C. Inner Grooved Copper Tube is engineered specifically to enhance the cooling capacity of the Air Conditioner and keeps you cool in the scorching heat of the summer.\n\nCross Flow Fan Design\n\nWhen the power is off and then it gets on again the unit automatically restores the previous function settings.\n\nNo.1 Nationwide\n\nOrient has successfully gained the trust of its customers and within a short span of time it has become the largest selling Air Conditioner company in Pakistan. Advanced technology, state of the art assembly line and special emphasis on Research and Development has helped Orient reach the top.\n\nEnergy Efficient\n\nEnergy is the most efficient and critical resource for the world today. Orient Air Conditioners are designed from a consumer's point of view making them not energy efficient but also environment friendly. Our energy efficient products are a testimony to our advanced technology and dedicated team of professionals\n\nState of the Art\nAir Vane Technology\n\nApart from special structure design and microcomputer control, Orient air conditioner series owns unique rotary air vane technology. In cooling mode, air vane is opened counter clockwise. Cool air blows out horizontally and then falls down by gravitation. Thus room temperature is quickly and evenly achieved.\n\nLow Noise\nAir Flow System\n\nWithout decreasing the flow volume, the large diameter cross flow fan can greatly reduce the indoor unit's noise by lowering fan speed and thus creating a quiet and comfortable environment for you.\n\nSleep Mode\n\nThis function enables the unit to automatically increase (cooling) or decrease (heating) 1C per hour for the first two hours, then holds steady for the next 5 hours, before stopping its operation. It can maintain the most comfortable temperature and save energy.\n\nTurbo Mode\n\nThe turbo mode helps in achieving lowest temperatures in minimum time.\n\nAuto Restart \nFunction\n\nWhen the power is off and then it gets on again the unit automatically restores the previous function settings.\n\nMulti-Bend \nHeat Exchanger\n\nCompared with conventional models, Orient air conditioners adopt multi-bend exchangers. It helps increase the heat exchange surface so that it improves efficiency.\n\nAuto Temperature \nAdjustment\n\nThe ceiling temperature is often higher than the floor temperature. This function can automatically eliminate the temperature difference between them.\n\nAnti Rust \nCabinet\n\nMade from electrolytic zinc steel sheet and anti-rust coated components, Orient air conditioners' outdoor unit is rust-free even in areas near the seashore.\n\nGeneral\t\t\n\tCapacity\t2.0  Tons\n\tEnergy Efficiency Rating\t-\n\tCooling Capacity\t7033 W\n\tRemote Control\tY\n\tCompressor\t-\n\tColor\t-\n\tDehumidification\t-\n\t\t\nAdditional Features\t\t\n\tIndoor Noise Level - High\t-\n\tSleep Mode\tY\n\tTimer\tY\n\tAuto Restart\tY\n\tDust Filter\tY\n\tAnti - Bacteria Filter\t-\n\tOther Filters\t-\n\tOther Features\t-"

      "EconoTech is one of the most efficient air conditioners available today. With the introduction of smart technology this machine can interact with you through your home network as well as from anywhere in the world through your smart phone. With more cooling and functionality this air conditioner is the face of modern technology.\n\n\nInner Grooved Copper Tube Technology\nBased on Japanese technology Inner-grooved Copper Tube gives instant cooling even in extreme temperatures of up to 53?C. Inner Grooved Copper Tube is engineered specifically to enhance the cooling capacity of the Air Conditioner and keeps you cool in the scorching heat of the summer.\n\n\nCross Flow Fan Design\nWhen the power is off and then it gets on again the unit automatically restores the previous function settings.\n\n\nNo.1 Nationwide\nOrient has successfully gained the trust of its customers and within a short span of time it has become the largest selling Air Conditioner company in Pakistan. Advanced technology, state of the art assembly line and special emphasis on Research and Development has helped Orient reach the top.\n\n\nEnergy Efficient\nEnergy is the most efficient and critical resource for the world today. Orient Air Conditioners are designed from a consumer's point of view making them not energy efficient but also environment friendly. Our energy efficient products are a testimony to our advanced technology and dedicated team of professionals\n\nAir Vane Technology\nApart from special structure design and microcomputer control, Orient air conditioner series owns unique rotary air vane technology. In cooling mode, air vane is opened counter clockwise. Cool air blows out horizontally and then falls down by gravitation. Thus room temperature is quickly and evenly achieved.\n\nLow Noise\nAir Flow SystemWithout decreasing the flow volume, the large diameter cross flow fan can greatly reduce the indoor unit's noise by lowering fan speed and thus creating a quiet and comfortable environment for you.\n\nSleep Mode\nThis function enables the unit to automatically increase (cooling) or decrease (heating) 1C per hour for the first two hours, then holds steady for the next 5 hours, before stopping its operation. It can maintain the most comfortable temperature and save energy.\n\nTurbo Mode\nThe turbo mode helps in achieving lowest temperatures in minimum time.\n\nAuto Restart Function\nWhen the power is off and then it gets on again the unit automatically restores the previous function settings.\n\nMulti-Bend Heat Exchanger\nCompared with conventional models, Orient air conditioners adopt multi-bend exchangers. It helps increase the heat exchange surface so that it improves efficiency.\n\nAuto Temperature Adjustment\nThe ceiling temperature is often higher than the floor temperature. This function can automatically eliminate the temperature difference between them.\n\nAnti Rust Cabinet\nMade from electrolytic zinc steel sheet and anti-rust coated components, Orient air conditioners' outdoor unit is rust-free even in areas near the seashore.\nWarranty Claimable for products only sold by SZE\n17-Lawrence Road Lahore.

      "2.0 ton Green Air DC inverter R-410A GAW-24KIR / GAC-24KIR\n\n\nGreen Air Inverter efficiently controls the voltage current\nand frequency of compressor motor. The sensors monitor operating conditions and\nadjust the revolution speed of the compressor which directly regulates air\ncondition output. Optimum control of operation frequency results in eliminating\nthe consumption of excessive electricity and providing the most comfortable\nroom environment. The Inverter technology (DC) is the latest evolution of technology\nconcerning the electro motors of the compressors. An Inverter is used to\ncontrol the speed of the compressor motor, so as to continuously\nregulate the temperature. A microcontroller can sample each ambient air temperature and adjust accordingly the speed of the compressor. The inverter air conditioning units have\nincreased efficiency in contraction to traditional air conditioners,\nextended life of their parts and the sharp fluctuations in the load are\neliminated. This makes the inverter AC units quieter, with lower\noperating cost and with less broke downs.\n\n\n\n\nMake: China"

The\ndevelop technology benefit both the environment and you electricity bill, so\nyour intentions don’t have to prevent you from living a confortable life\n\n\n\n\n\nR-32 is a new refrigerant\ncurrently receiving the most interest. Because R-32 efficiently conveys heat, it can reduce\nelectricity consumption up to approximately 30% compared to that of air\nconditioners using refrigerant R-22. Furthermore, compared to the refrigerants\nwidely used today such as R-22 and R-410A, R-32 has a global warming potential\n(GWP) that is one-third lower and is remarkable for its low environmental\nimpact. Moreover the cooling capacity of R-32 is also 20% more as compared R-410A, this is the reason why in coming years R-32 is going to be the primary refrigerant of choice in HVAC industry and this what most of the manufacturers are leaning towards. Eminent Air is first brand to launch in pakistan with R-32 technology.\n\nMake: Thailand"

      "Stable, Long-lasting Performance\nThe Samsung Air Conditioner keeps going in the most challenging environments. Its Triple Protector Plus technology prevents the compressor and controller from being overloaded by power surges and fluctuating electrical currents, without a separate voltage stabiliser. It also has an anti-corrosive coating to stop the condenser from corrosion, and cabinet from rusting. And its larger condenser and optimised refrigerant flow mean it can endure extremely hot temperatures (up to 58ºC)*. * Tested on AR09HPSDDWK/SG. Compared with Samsung conventional model AR09HPSDFAP/RC\nEasy to Take Out and Clean\nUnlike conventional filters that are often difficult to access, the Samsung Air Conditioner’s Easy Filter is located outside, on the top. So it can easily be taken out, cleaned and put back - without having to open a cover or pull hard to get it out. And its anti-bacterial coating filters dust, dangerous airborne contaminants and allergens.* * Tested in Korea test lab (FITI / KEMTI) and Japan test lab (ITEA). Data has been measured under specific testing conditions and may differ based on environmental factors.\nEasy Troubleshooting\nThe Samsung Air Conditioner includes Smart Check, an automatic error-monitoring system. It detects and diagnoses problems at an early stage and provides quick and easy troubleshooting solutions using a smartphone App*. So it saves you time having to find the manual and avoids the cost and inconvenience of unnecessary engineer callouts** – and potentially expensive repair bills. * Available on iPhones and Android devices. ** This function operates for certain error mode only and is not substitute for periodic service checkup.\nSmartly Convenient\nWith the Samsung Air Conditioner you can enjoy the confidence that it's perfectly installed and the convenience of remote control and trouble-shooting. Smart Installation checks for common problems to make sure it is properly installed. Using an App on your smartphone, Smart Wi-Fi lets you monitor and change energy settings from anywhere and Smart Check lets you diagnose errors and request a service immediately.\nEnsure Perfect Installation\nSmart Installation is a self-diagnosis feature that ensures your Samsung Air Conditioner is installed perfectly by your service engineer. It automatically checks for installation faults that can cause problems when using the air conditioner, including ineffective communication with the outdoor unit, any issues with the integrity of the air pipe and poor refrigerant flow.\n\n\n\n\n24HPFSDWK / SG\nGeneral\t\t\n\tCapacity\t2.0 Tons\n\tEnergy Efficiency Rating\t-\n\tCooling Capacity\t-\n\tRemote Control\tY\n\tCompressor\t-\n\tColor\t-\n\tDehumidification\t-\n\t\t\nAdditional Features\t\t\n\tIndoor Noise Level - High\t41 / 31 Db\n\tSleep Mode\tY\n\tTimer\tY\n\tAuto Restart\t-\n\tDust Filter\t-\n\tAnti - Bacteria Filter\t-\n\tOther Filters\t-\n\tOther Features\t-\n\t\t\nDimensions\t\t\n\tIndoor W x H x D\t1,063 X 294 X 317\n\tIndoor Unit Weight\t13.4 Kg\n\tOutdoor W x H x D\t790 X 545 X 285\n\tOutdoor Unit Weight\t45\n\t\t\nWarranty\tPeriod\t3 Years Compressor & 1 Year Parts\n\t\t\n\t\t\nPower Features\t\t\n\tOperating Current\t8 - 8.3 A\n\tPower Consumption\t1900 W\n\tPower Requirement\t220-240 V/50 Hz\nWarranty Claimable for products only sold by SZE\n17-Lawrence Road Lahore.

      "Free installation for Karachi, Lahore & Islamabad only:\n(The installation team will first call for verification and will then reach the desired delivery location within 48 hours after delivery of the product)\nStable, Long-lasting Performance\nThe Samsung Air Conditioner keeps going in the most challenging environments. Its Triple Protector Plus technology prevents the compressor and controller from being overloaded by power surges and fluctuating electrical currents, without a separate voltage stabiliser. It also has an anti-corrosive coating to stop the condenser from corrosion, and cabinet from rusting. And its larger condenser and optimised refrigerant flow mean it can endure extremely hot temperatures (up to 58ºC)*. * Tested on AR09HPSDDWK/SG. Compared with Samsung conventional model AR09HPSDFAP/RC\nEasy to Take Out and Clean\nUnlike conventional filters that are often difficult to access, the Samsung Air Conditioner’s Easy Filter is located outside, on the top. So it can easily be taken out, cleaned and put back - without having to open a cover or pull hard to get it out. And its anti-bacterial coating filters dust, dangerous airborne contaminants and allergens.* * Tested in Korea test lab (FITI / KEMTI) and Japan test lab (ITEA). Data has been measured under specific testing conditions and may differ based on environmental factors.\nEasy Troubleshooting\nThe Samsung Air Conditioner includes Smart Check, an automatic error-monitoring system. It detects and diagnoses problems at an early stage and provides quick and easy troubleshooting solutions using a smartphone App*. So it saves you time having to find the manual and avoids the cost and inconvenience of unnecessary engineer callouts** – and potentially expensive repair bills. * Available on iPhones and Android devices. ** This function operates for certain error mode only and is not substitute for periodic service checkup.\nSmartly Convenient\nWith the Samsung Air Conditioner you can enjoy the confidence that it's perfectly installed and the convenience of remote control and trouble-shooting. Smart Installation checks for common problems to make sure it is properly installed. Using an App on your smartphone, Smart Wi-Fi lets you monitor and change energy settings from anywhere and Smart Check lets you diagnose errors and request a service immediately.\nEnsure Perfect Installation\nSmart Installation is a self-diagnosis feature that ensures your Samsung Air Conditioner is installed perfectly by your service engineer. It automatically checks for installation faults that can cause problems when using the air conditioner, including ineffective communication with the outdoor unit, any issues with the integrity of the air pipe and poor refrigerant flow.\n\n\n\n\n24HPFSDWK / SG\nGeneral\t\t\n\tCapacity\t1.0 Tons\n\tEnergy Efficiency Rating\t-\n\tCooling Capacity\t-\n\tRemote Control\tY\n\tCompressor\t-\n\tColor\t-\n\tDehumidification\t-\n\t\t\nAdditional Features\t\t\n\tIndoor Noise Level - High\t41 / 31 Db\n\tSleep Mode\tY\n\tTimer\tY\n\tAuto Restart\t-\n\tDust Filter\t-\n\tAnti - Bacteria Filter\t-\n\tOther Filters\t-\n\tOther Features\t-\n\t\t\nDimensions\t\t\n\tIndoor W x H x D\t1,063 X 294 X 317\n\tIndoor Unit Weight\t13.4 Kg\n\tOutdoor W x H x D\t790 X 545 X 285\n\tOutdoor Unit Weight\t45\n\t\t\nWarranty\tPeriod\t3 Years Compressor & 1 Year Parts\n\t\t\n\t\t\nPower Features\t\t\n\tOperating Current\t8 - 8.3 A\n\tPower Consumption\t1900 W\n\tPower Requirement\t220-240 V/50 Hz\nWarranty Claimable for products only sold by SZE\n17-Lawrence Road Lahore.

      "Outstandingly efficient!\nEven it’s just beginning of May temperature in Pakistan can be harsh. In all such circumstances, get a save from the lethal heat countrywide. Air conditioners are a necessity in today’s time as they save you from the tormenting weather in summers and allow you to lead a comfortable life. After a tiring day at work, relaxing in your room with the air conditioner on is all that you will ask for. If you are looking forward to purchase an air conditioner and are confused between which product to go for, choose H Zone 15 - 1 ton Air Conditioner to make your life easier.\n\nCools Faster, Farther, and Wider\nDesigned to be outstandingly efficient. Its unique design has a wider inlet, so more air can be drawn in. The improved width and angle of its outlet, extra blades and a bigger fan also ensure that air is cooled and expelled faster, farther and wider. So refreshingly cool air reaches every corner of your room.\n\nSave Energy Even When Alone\nIt uses less compressor capacity, reducing power consumption, while still providing a cool and comfortable environment. So you can use it when you’re alone, even during a hot day, without worrying about the electricity bill. \n\nEasy to Take Out and Clean\nUnlike conventional filters that are often difficult to access, this easy filter is located outside, on the top. So it can easily be taken out, cleaned and put back – without having to open a cover or pull hard to get it out. And its anti-bacterial coating filters dust, dangerous airborne contaminants and allergens."

Thus room temperature is quickly and evenly achieved.\n\nLow Noise\nAir Flow System\n\nWithout decreasing the flow volume, the large diameter cross flow fan can greatly reduce the indoor unit's noise by lowering fan speed and thus creating a quiet and comfortable environment for you.\n\nSleep Mode\n\nThis function enables the unit to automatically increase (cooling) or decrease (heating) 1C per hour for the first two hours, then holds steady for the next 5 hours, before stopping its operation. It can maintain the most comfortable temperature and save energy.\n\nTurbo Mode\n\nThe turbo mode helps in achieving lowest temperatures in minimum time.\n\nAuto Restart \nFunction\n\nWhen the power is off and then it gets on again the unit automatically restores the previous function settings.\n\nMulti-Bend \nHeat Exchanger\n\nCompared with conventional models, Orient air conditioners adopt multi-bend exchangers. It helps increase the heat exchange surface so that it improves efficiency.\n\nAuto Temperature \nAdjustment\n\nThe ceiling temperature is often higher than the floor temperature. This function can automatically eliminate the temperature difference between them.\n\nAnti Rust \nCabinet\n\nMade from electrolytic zinc steel sheet and anti-rust coated components, Orient air conditioners' outdoor unit is rust-free even in areas near the seashore.\n\n\n\n\nALC18CR/AWM20JR\nGeneral\t\t\n\tCapacity\t1.5 Tons\n\tEnergy Efficiency Rating\t-\n\tCooling Capacity\t5720 W\n\tRemote Control\tY\n\tCompressor\t-\n\tColor\t-\n\tDehumidification\t-\n\t\t\nAdditional Features\t\t\n\tIndoor Noise Level - High\t-\n\tSleep Mode\tY\n\tTimer\tY\n\tAuto Restart\tY\n\tDust Filter\tY\n\tAnti - Bacteria Filter\t-\n\tOther Filters\t-\n\tOther Features\t-\n\n"

In cooling mode, air vane is opened counter clockwise. Cool air blows out horizontally and then falls down by gravitation. Thus room temperature drop is quickly and evenly achieved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSleep Mode\nThis function enables the unit to automatically increase (cooling) or decrease (heating) 1C° per hour for the first two hours, then holds steady for the next 5 hours, before stopping its operation. It can maintain the most comfortable temperature and save energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuto Restart Function\n When the power is off and then it gets on again the unit automatically restores the previous function settings. \n\n\n\n\nFeatures\nHeat and Cool Technology\nAir Vane Technology\nLow Noise Air Flow System\nSleep Mode\nTurbo Mode\nAuto Restart Function\nMulti-Bend Heat Exchanger\nAuto Temperature Adjustment\nAnti Rust Cabinet\n\n\nSpecification\nCooling\n12000btu\nPower Input\n1250W\nEER\n9.5\n\nWarranty Claimable for products only sold by SZE\n17-Lawrence Road Lahore.

      "Cools Faster Farther and Wider: The Samsung Air Conditioner has been designed from the ground up to be outstandingly efficient. Its uniquely triangular design has a wider inlet so more air can be drawn in. The improved width and angle of its outlet extra v-blades and a bigger fan also ensure that air is cooled and expelled faster farther and wider*. So refreshingly cool air reaches every corner of your room. * Tested on AR09HSFSBWK model. Compared with Samsung conventional model AQV09TWS.\n\n\nCools You Fast Then Cools You Comfortably: The Samsung Air Conditioner begins cooling the air fast using its powerful Fast Cool mode so it gets there quickly. It then automatically changes the mode to Comfort Cool to maintain the desired temperature. So you won’t feel cold and don’t have to keep manually changing the settings or turning the Air Conditioner on and off.\n\n\nAutomatically Save Energy: With Single User mode you don’t have to repeatedly turn the Samsung Air Conditioner on and off to save energy or worry about using it if it’s not unbearably hot. Inthis mode the compressor and fan only run long enough to maintain the desired temperature and automatically shut off when they’re not needed. So it uses much less electricity * – keeping your bills low and your rooms cool. * Tested on AR12HPSDDWK. Based on accumulated power consumption of normal mode vs. single user mode.\n\n\nEliminates Viruses: Virus Doctor and Easy Filter eliminates dust dangerous airborne contaminants and allergens as well as bacteria and viruses including the Influenza A and Corona viruses* – firstly using a filter and secondly with Virus Doctor. So it keeps the air you breathe clean and healthy. * Tested in Kitasato Environmental Science Centre (Japan) & Yonsei Univ. (Korea) / Korea test lab (FITI / KEMTI) and Japan test lab (ITEA). Effective on 4 viruses including Subtype H1N1 and certain bacteria. Data has been measured under specific testing conditions and may differ based on environmental factors.\nStable Long-lasting Performance: The Samsung Air Conditioner keeps going in the most challenging environments. Its Triple Protector Plus technology prevents the compressor and controller from being overloaded by power surges and fluctuating electrical currents without a separate voltage stabiliser. It also has an anti-corrosive coating to stop the condenser from corrosion and cabinet from rusting. And its larger condenser and optimised refrigerant flow mean it can endure extremely hot temperatures (up to 58ºC)*. * Tested on AR09HPSDDWK/SG. Compared with Samsung conventional model AR09HPSDFAP/RC\nEasy to Take Out and Clean: Unlike conventional filters that are often difficult to access the Samsung Air Conditioner’s Easy Filter is located outside on the top. So it can easily be taken out cleaned and put back - without having to open a cover or pull hard to get it out. And its anti-bacterial coating filters dust dangerous airborne contaminants and allergens.* * Tested in Korea test lab (FITI / KEMTI) and Japan test lab (ITEA). Data has been measured under specific testing conditions and may differ based on environmental factors.\nEasy Troubleshooting: The Samsung Air Conditioner includes Smart Check an automatic error-monitoring system. It detects and diagnoses problems at an early stage and provides quick and easy troubleshooting solutions using a smartphone App*. So it saves you time having to find the manual and avoids the cost and inconvenience of unnecessary engineer callouts** – and potentially expensive repair bills. * Available on iPhones and Android devices. ** This function operates for certain error mode only and is not substitute for periodic service checkup.\nSmartly Convenient: With the Samsung Air Conditioner you can enjoy the confidence that it's perfectly installed and the convenience of remote control and trouble-shooting. Smart Installation checks for common problems to make sure it is properly installed. Using an App on your smartphone Smart Wi-Fi lets you monitor and change energy settings from anywhere and Smart Check lets you diagnose errors and request a service immediately.\n\n\nWarranty Claimable for products only sold by SZE\n17-Lawrence Road Lahore.

      "State of the Art\nAir Vane Technology\n\nApart from special structure design and microcomputer control, Orient air conditioner series owns unique rotary air vane technology. In cooling mode, air vane is opened counter clockwise. Cool air blows out horizontally and then falls down by gravitation. Thus room temperature is quickly and evenly achieved.\n\n \nLow Noise\nAir Flow System\n\nWithout decreasing the flow volume, the large diameter cross flow fan can greatly reduce the indoor unit's noise by lowering fan speed and thus creating a quiet and comfortable environment for you.\n\n \nSleep Mode\n\nThis function enables the unit to automatically increase (cooling) or decrease (heating) 1C per hour for the first two hours, then holds steady for the next 5 hours, before stopping its operation. It can maintain the most comfortable temperature and save energy.\n\n \nTurbo Mode\n\nThe turbo mode helps in achieving lowest temperatures in minimum time.\n\n \nAuto Restart \nFunction\n\nWhen the power is off and then it gets on again the unit automatically restores the previous function settings.\n\n \nMulti-Bend \nHeat Exchanger\n\nCompared with conventional models, Orient air conditioners adopt multi-bend exchangers. It helps increase the heat exchange surface so that it improves efficiency.\n\n \nAuto Temperature \nAdjustment\n\nThe ceiling temperature is often higher than the floor temperature. This function can automatically eliminate the temperature difference between them.\n\n \nAnti Rust \nCabinet\n\nMade from electrolytic zinc steel sheet and anti-rust coated components, Orient air conditioners' outdoor unit is rust-free even in areas near the seashore.\n\nWarranty Claimable for products only sold by SZE\n17-Lawrence Road Lahore.

      "\nEconoTech is one of the most efficient air conditioners available today. With the introduction of smart technology this machine can interact with you through your home network as well as from anywhere in the world through your smart phone. With more cooling and functionality this air conditioner is the face of modern technology.\n\n\nInner Grooved Copper Tube Technology\nBased on Japanese technology Inner-grooved Copper Tube gives instant cooling even in extreme temperatures of up to 53?C. Inner Grooved Copper Tube is engineered specifically to enhance the cooling capacity of the Air Conditioner and keeps you cool in the scorching heat of the summer.\n\n\nCross Flow Fan Design\nWhen the power is off and then it gets on again the unit automatically restores the previous function settings.\n\n\nNo.1 Nationwide\nOrient has successfully gained the trust of its customers and within a short span of time it has become the largest selling Air Conditioner company in Pakistan. Advanced technology, state of the art assembly line and special emphasis on Research and Development has helped Orient reach the top.\n\n\nEnergy Efficient\nEnergy is the most efficient and critical resource for the world today. Orient Air Conditioners are designed from a consumer's point of view making them not energy efficient but also environment friendly. Our energy efficient products are a testimony to our advanced technology and dedicated team of professionals\n\nAir Vane Technology\nApart from special structure design and microcomputer control, Orient air conditioner series owns unique rotary air vane technology. In cooling mode, air vane is opened counter clockwise. Cool air blows out horizontally and then falls down by gravitation. Thus room temperature is quickly and evenly achieved.\n\nLow Noise Air Flow System\nWithout decreasing the flow volume, the large diameter cross flow fan can greatly reduce the indoor unit's noise by lowering fan speed and thus creating a quiet and comfortable environment for you.\n\nSleep Mode\nThis function enables the unit to automatically increase (cooling) or decrease (heating) 1C per hour for the first two hours, then holds steady for the next 5 hours, before stopping its operation. It can maintain the most comfortable temperature and save energy.\n\nTurbo Mode\nThe turbo mode helps in achieving lowest temperatures in minimum time.\n\nAuto Restart Function\nWhen the power is off and then it gets on again the unit automatically restores the previous function settings.\n\nMulti-Bend Heat Exchanger\nCompared with conventional models, Orient air conditioners adopt multi-bend exchangers. It helps increase the heat exchange surface so that it improves efficiency.\n\nAuto Temperature Adjustment\nThe ceiling temperature is often higher than the floor temperature. This function can automatically eliminate the temperature difference between them.\n\nAnti Rust Cabinet\nMade from electrolytic zinc steel sheet and anti-rust coated components, Orient air conditioners' outdoor unit is rust-free even in areas near the seashore.\nWarranty Claimable for products only sold by SZE\n17-Lawrence Road Lahore.

The develop technology benefit both the environment and you electricity bill, so your intentions don’t have to prevent you from living a confortable life\n\nR-32 is a new refrigerant currently receiving the most interest. Because R-32 efficiently conveys heat, it can reduce electricity consumption up to approximately 30% compared to that of air conditioners using refrigerant R-22. Furthermore, compared to the refrigerants widely used today such as R-22 and R-410A, R-32 has a global warming potential (GWP) that is one-third lower and is remarkable for its low environmental impact. Moreover the cooling capacity of R-32 is also 20% more as compared R-410A, this is the reason why in coming years R-32 is going to be the primary refrigerant of choice in HVAC industry and this what most of the manufacturers are leaning towards. Eminent Air is first brand to launch in pakistan with R-32 technology.\n\nMake: Thailand"
