Pur Colour

Purcolour technology brings images to life in just the way nature intended
for us to see them. The clear expression and abundance of true-to-life tones
will astound your eyes and excite your senses as it recreates more natural
and realistic colours onscreen.

ConventionalUHD 4K
UHD 4K

4K UHD brings out the finest details in all your viewing material.
With 3840 x 2160 pixels onscreen every nuance is clear and ready
for you to feast your eyes upon. Resolution up to four times
that of Full HD TV ensures you'll experience sharper, more
accurate images with immaculate true-to-life colour expression.

HDR

You may not have realized how much you were missing
in your day to day viewing before HDR brought the light
out of the shadows. Expect images with higher brightness
as a whole new world of detail is revealed and
brought to life. All images come closer to reality
thanks to HDR technology.

UHD Upscaling

The Samsung UHD TV automatically optimises general content
so you'll always enjoy a UHD-level viewing experience
no matter the original quality. By using a 4-step upscaling process,
details are enhanced as frame noise is eliminated.
The resulting picture quality is beautifully clear
and generally better all-round.

UHD Dimming

The Samsung UHD TV takes full advantage of its processing power
to exercise total software control of picture enhancement.
The screen itself is divided up into hundreds of zones
that are each individually analysed and adjusted to optimise colour,
brightness and sharpness. The result is more accurate and sharper images.",Warranty,1 x 70KU7000 - Flat Smart TV - 70” UHD 4K - Black,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"EN

Moreover if you want to visit a webpage, just say its complete web address. You can therefore use your voice commands to control your intelligent smart TV.

to worry about bad picture and distorted colour schemes. With the 3D Comb
Filter it helps to correct detail and colour loss that when the TV tries to
render signals on the screen by layering several versions of images on top of
each other. Unlike normal LED TVs you will find a much better colour scheme and
seamless colour quality.





 








 




Get Wired




 





Life can be
difficult without an HDMI port/cable in your device. A TV without an HDMI is
like a listening to a cricket match on radio. An HDMI is a good, single-wire,
digital audio/video interface essentially required to connect you TV to a
digital cable box, satellite box, DVD player, external Blu-ray player, computer,
 gaming console, tablet, smartphone or any
other device with an HDMI output. This magnificent TV set features HDMI input
ports, in order to connect multiple devices simultaneously.

varying volume level a turnoff while you keep switching between the channels?
All you need to do is active the AVL function the automatically adjusts the
sound function while you browse through the channels while the audio levels
remain constant.

The realistic detail of Full HD images invites you to enjoy a viewing experience that redifines reality.

Clear Motion Rate 240

A Clear Motion Rate of 240 is a brilliant level of motion-clarity. TVs with this CMR can display action-packed movement with sharpness, clarity and contrast. Clear Motion Rate was developed to accurately measure how well an LCD or LED TV can depict fast-moving images. Previously, motion-clarity was calculated by the frame refresh rate alone. But CMR offers a more complete measure by calculating 3 factors: frame refresh rate, image processor speed and backlight technology.

Wide Color Enhancer Plus

Wide Color Enhancer optimizes hues and expands the color range for a more vivid viewing experience, especially when watching older film productions and non-HD content.

ConnectShare™ Movie

ConnectShare™ Movie lets you watch videos, play music or view photos* from a USB connection without needing to use a PC or special equipment. Simply plug your USB directly into your Samsung TV's USB port and watch on the big screen with friends and family.* Supported formats include AVI, ASF, MP3, JPEG and others. See user manual for full list of supported video/music/photo formats.

Great multitasking with Multi-Link Screen




Unlike other traditional TV sets this TV bring your Samsung’s Multi-Link Screen to give your entertainment experience to a whole new level by providing multiple-screen viewing, as you can perform multiple tasks while watching the feed too. You can browse the web for the information of your favourite show that you're watching on the screen simultaneously.








Speak to Control


Just imagine, how fascinating it becomes when you start controlling your products and gadgets by commanding them verbally. Samsung’s latest voice interaction feature allows you to control your TV by uttering one word commands. In that case, if you’re planning to watch a film, you just have to say ‘find’ and the title of the movie and it will play on your screen right away. Moreover if you want to visit a webpage, just say its complete web address. You can therefore use your voice commands to control your intelligent smart TV.
