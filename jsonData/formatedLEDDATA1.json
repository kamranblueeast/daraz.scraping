      "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand your TV\n\n \n\n \n\nHow fascinating it becomes when you start controlling your products and gadgets by commanding them verbally. Samsung’s latest voice interaction feature allows you to control your TV by uttering one word commands.  In that case, if you’re planning to watch a film, you just have to say ‘find’ and the title of the movie and it will play on your screen right away. Moreover if you want to visit a webpage, just say its complete web address. You can therefore use your voice commands to control your intelligent smart TV.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTV smarter than You\n\n \n\n \n\nSamsung Smart Control makes your TV experience luxurious than before. You can easily flip between smart Hub panels and scroll pages up and down by pointing the remote. Moreover you can also use the Motion Control feature to navigate using the cursor and entering text without any hassle too. Valuable features like video control keys allow you to watch your already streamed or downloaded movies and content whenever you feel like watching it.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n3D Home Cinema\n\n \n\nAre you crazy about 3D and love watching 3D movies to bits? Do you always find it difficult or tiring driving all the way to the cinema to watch a 3D movie? Samsung has solved all your issues by bringing in the 3D Screens to your doorstep.

      "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe amazing Curved Panel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese technical curves have made the TV watching a new experience. With a curved screen, it provides a panoramic view that wraps all your surroundings in one image for you. Unlike Flat TVs, the curved design allows you to enjoy and view all the areas of screen with true colours and brighter images. So enjoy the benefits of the enormous curves based on advanced viewing technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Remote Does it For You!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamsung Smart Control makes your TV experience luxurious than before. You can easily flip between smart Hub panels and scroll pages up and down by pointing the remote. Moreover you can also use the Motion Control feature to navigate using the cursor and entering text without any hassle too. Valuable features like video control keys allow you to watch your already streamed or downloaded movies and content whenever you feel like watching it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnlarge Your Mobile Screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine you’re sitting in the other room and want to share something with family on their screen watching TV. The screen mirroring allows you to wirelessly access and share images, videos and music from your mobile, PC, tablet and camera devices to your Smart TV without any sort of hindrance.

TVs with this CMR can display action-packed movement with sharpness, clarity and contrast. Clear Motion Rate was developed to accurately measure how well an LCD or LED TV can depict fast-moving images. Previously, motion-clarity was calculated by the frame refresh rate alone. But CMR offers a more complete measure by calculating 3 factors: frame refresh rate, image processor speed and backlight technology.\n\nWide Color Enhancer Plus\n\nWide Color Enhancer optimizes hues and expands the color range for a more vivid viewing experience, especially when watching older film productions and non-HD content.\n\nConnectShare™ Movie\n\nConnectShare™ Movie lets you watch videos, play music or view photos* from a USB connection without needing to use a PC or special equipment.
