With HDR Premium, you can enjoy previously unseen details hidden in the brightest parts of the TV screen when watching HDR content. A theatre-like, true HDR experience is finally available right in your living room.

Experience more accurate and natural colours

Samsung developed a special colour technology for our UHD TV called PurColour, which expresses a wider range of colours and shades that are as close to real life as it gets, bringing you closer to what nature intended. With all the 8 million pixels that come with a UHD display—four times more than a Full HD display—you need more colour adjustment points to create detailed images. Conventional UHD TVs have about 27 colour adjustment points, but PurColour dramatically increases that by more than 7 times, resulting in colours and shades that are much richer and more refined.

Every detail in stunning 4K UHD resolution

Experience vivid detail with 4X the resolution of Full HD TV. Everything you watch will look better thanks to true-to-life colour and brightness.

Quick and Single Access to all Content Sources

New Smart Hub provides single access point to Live TV, Over The Top (OTT), Games and more . Users can access to their favourite content as soon as they turn on the TV.

*Requires Internet access. May not be available in all languages or areas.

Upscale content for vivid image quality

Samsung’s UHD Picture Engine gives you near UHD-level pictures even when streaming lower resolution contents. It uses an innovative 4-step process to convert your favourite content into premium life-like quality.

*Upscaled image quality will vary depending on the source resolution

Enhanced contrasts for your viewing experience

UHD Dimming technology provides optimised contrast, colour and sharpness for true-to-life image quality. More intricate than the existing Micro Dimming, it’s a viewing experience like never before.

Step up your picture quality to near-UHD

Ultra Clean View analyses your content with an advanced algorithm to filter and reduce noise. Even if the video source is less than Full HD quality, you’ll still be able to enjoy images that rival the UHD standard.*

*Picture quality may vary based on original source feed.

Easily share your content to TV

Take pictures, videos and music from your mobile and PC to your Smart TV using the Samsung Smart View app. It gives you amazing convergence and easy connectivity, with majority of personal devices .

*Setup requires your TV and mobile device to be on the same network (AP) *Supported feature may vary by OS and devices. *For more information on supported devices, please go to www.samsung.com/smartview

Faster speeds, stronger performance

With HDR Premium, you can enjoy previously unseen details hidden in the brightest parts of the TV screen when watching HDR content. A theatre-like, true HDR experience is finally available right in your living room.

Experience more accurate and natural colours

Samsung developed a special colour technology for our UHD TV called PurColour, which expresses a wider range of colours and shades that are as close to real life as it gets, bringing you closer to what nature intended. With all the 8 million pixels that come with a UHD display—four times more than a Full HD display—you need more colour adjustment points to create detailed images. Conventional UHD TVs have about 27 colour adjustment points, but PurColour dramatically increases that by more than 7 times, resulting in colours and shades that are much richer and more refined.

Every detail in stunning 4K UHD resolution

Experience vivid detail with 4X the resolution of Full HD TV. Everything you watch will look better thanks to true-to-life colour and brightness.

Quick and Single Access to all Content Sources

New Smart Hub provides single access point to Live TV, Over The Top (OTT), Games and more . Users can access to their favourite content as soon as they turn on the TV.

*Requires Internet access. May not be available in all languages or areas.

Upscale content for vivid image quality

Samsung’s UHD Picture Engine gives you near UHD-level pictures even when streaming lower resolution contents. It uses an innovative 4-step process to convert your favourite content into premium life-like quality.

*Upscaled image quality will vary depending on the source resolution

Enhanced contrasts for your viewing experience

UHD Dimming technology provides optimised contrast, colour and sharpness for true-to-life image quality. More intricate than the existing Micro Dimming, it’s a viewing experience like never before.

Step up your picture quality to near-UHD

Ultra Clean View analyses your content with an advanced algorithm to filter and reduce noise. Even if the video source is less than Full HD quality, you’ll still be able to enjoy images that rival the UHD standard.*

*Picture quality may vary based on original source feed.

Easily share your content to TV

Take pictures, videos and music from your mobile and PC to your Smart TV using the Samsung Smart View app. It gives you amazing convergence and easy connectivity, with majority of personal devices .

*Setup requires your TV and mobile device to be on the same network (AP) *Supported feature may vary by OS and devices. *For more information on supported devices, please go to www.samsung.com/smartview

HDR Pro adjusts the brightness of your screen to bring a life-like clarity to the images it projects. With LG UHD TV, you can enhance the colors by adjusting the brightness of your screen to bring out every detail. Now, you can enjoy vivid and vibrant content with HDR Pro.

ColorPrime Pro

ColorPrime Pro creates vivid images using a wide range of colors.
The LG UHD TV brings true excitement with richer colors.

Wide Viewing Angle

Due to the nature of the display, the image on the screen maintains its integrity from any viewing angle. This allows you to enjoy dynamic, vibrant color from every seat in the room.

ULTRA Luminance

ULTRA Luminance sends excess current from dark areas to brighter areas to enhance contrast. Combine the LG UHD TV’s excellent ability to express darkness with its distinct contrast between dark and light, and you have an image that is as sharp and clear as real life.

3D color Mapping

3D color Mapping expresses lifelike color through its 3D Gamut Mapping algorithm.
It minimizes color distortion, allowing viewers to enjoy remarkably natural color.",Day2day_Electronic,"LED, Remote, Batteries, TV Stand, Wall Mount, Manual(s), Warranty Card",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,H5100,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Discover thrilling HDR entertainment

This TV brings you the excitement of shows and movies in vividly detailed HDR. It handles a variety of HDR formats, including HDR10 and Hybrid Log-Gamma.1

Enjoy HDR gaming 

Sony’s 4K HDR televisions make excellent partners for PlayStation®4 and PlayStation®4 Pro consoles.2 Immerse yourself in a responsive, fun-filled gaming experience with intensely vibrant colours. See your favourite games come to life with incredible picture quality.3  

Made to listen: ClearAudio+

Your listening is as lifelike as your viewing. ClearAudio+ fine tunes TV sound for an immersive, emotionally enriching experience that seems to surround you. Hear music and dialogue with greater clarity and separation, whatever you’re watching.

Say what you want to see with voice search

Spend less time browsing, and more time watching. Voice search on Android TV™ provides you with the power of Google search, allowing you to find content across different services without the hassle of time-consuming text entry. You can also get recommendations; asking for “romantic comedies” for example, brings up a list of suitable options. 

Chromecast built-in: Plays nice with your other devices

Cinematic S-Force Front Surround

Enjoy an immersive soundstage that pulls you into the heart of the action. S-Force Front Surround mimics the way the brain correlates sound sources to create proper volume, time lag, and sound wave spectrum – using only left and right speaker channels. By naturally emulating three-dimensional sound fields, you’ll enjoy rich, high-fidelity audio across a wider listening area.

Clear Phase for smooth, balanced frequencies

BRAVIA™ uses a powerful computer model to analyse and compensate for inaccuracies in speaker response. It does this by ‘sampling’ the speaker frequency with higher precision. This information is fed back to cancel out any peaks or dips in the speaker’s natural response – resulting in pure, natural audio with smooth, even reproduction of all frequencies.

Motionflow™ XR keeps the action smooth

Enjoy smooth and sharp details even in fast-moving sequences with Motionflow™ XR. This innovative technology creates and inserts extra frames between the original ones.

It boasts DDR3 2GB RAM, and eMMC 16GB Flash, advantageous in performance, security and reliability, ascribing to the eMMC memory, ultimately delivering a richer end-user experience. You can go directly to let your TV and X96 TV Box are connected through an HDMI cable and set up your home cinema for the best 4K x 2K UHD multimedia experience.

HDMI Connectivity




It is said that a TV without HDMI is like a listening to a cricket match on radio. An HDMI is a good, single-wire, digital audio/video interface essentially required to connect you TV to a digital cable box, satellite box, DVD player, external Blu-ray player, computer,  gaming console, tablet, smartphone or any other device with an HDMI output. This magnificent TV set features HDMI input ports, in order to connect multiple devices simultaneously.
